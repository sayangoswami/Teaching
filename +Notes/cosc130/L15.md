# Aggregation & Composition

Using a **[Simple GUI Library](https://github.com/sayangoswami/SimpleGUI)**

---

##  A Motivating Example

So far, we've used **Inheritance ("IS-A")** to define an object's type.

- `StudentFormHandler` **IS-A** `FormSubmitHandler`
    
- `Student` **IS-A** `Rowable`
    

--

But this doesn't work for all relationships. Let's model a `Car`:

- A `Car` **IS-A** `Vehicle`?
    
    - Yes, that makes sense. (Inheritance)
        
- A `Car` **IS-A** `Engine`?
    
    - No, that's wrong. A car is not a _type_ of engine.
        
- A `Car` **HAS-A** `Engine`?
    
    - **Yes!** A car is a complex object _built from_ other objects.
        

This "HAS-A" relationship is the key to building complex programs.

---

##  "IS-A" vs. "HAS-A"

### 1. "IS-A" (Inheritance / Interface)

- **What:** A relationship of _type_ and _specialization_.
    
- **Key Idea:** `Student` **is a** `Rowable`. It _inherits_ the contract of a `Rowable` and provides a specific implementation.
    
- **When:** Use it to enable polymorphism—treating different objects in the same way (e.g., adding any `PageComponent` to a `Page`).
    
--
### 2. "HAS-A" (Composition / Aggregation)

- **What:** A relationship of _construction_ and _components_.
    
- **Key Idea:** A `Car` **has an** `Engine`. It _contains_ an `Engine` as one of its parts.
    
- **When:** Use it to build complex objects out of simpler ones.
    
---
##  Aggregation vs. Composition

"HAS-A" has two common flavors. The main difference is about _ownership_ and _lifecycle_.

### Aggregation (Weak "HAS-A")

The "part" can exist _independently_ of the "whole".

- **Example:** A `Course` _has_ `Student`s.
    
- **Lifecycle:** If you delete the `Course` object, the `Student` objects still exist. The `Course` doesn't _own_ the students; it just holds a reference to them.
    
--
### Composition (Strong "HAS-A")

The "part" _cannot_ exist without the "whole". The "whole" _owns_ and _manages_ the "part".

- **Example:** A `Car` _has an_ `Engine`.
    
- **Lifecycle:** If you delete the `Car` object, the `Engine` object is deleted too. The engine is an essential, internal part of the car.
    
---
##  How We Implement "HAS-A"

This is the best part: it's simple.

**You implement "HAS-A" relationships using instance variables.**

```java
// Example: Composition (A Car "owns" its Engine)
public class Car {
    
    // The Car HAS-A Engine.
    // It's private, because nothing else should touch it.
    private Engine engine; 

    public Car() {
        // The Car creates and "owns" its Engine.
        // The Engine's lifecycle is tied to the Car's.
        this.engine = new Engine();
    }

    public void start() {
        this.engine.ignite();
    }
}
```

##  Tying This to Our GUI Library

This is exactly how we build a dashboard!

**Problem:** How do we put _multiple_ components (charts, stats) on a _single page_?

- We can't use inheritance. A `DashboardPage` **IS-A** `Chart`? No.
    
- A `DashboardPage` **HAS-A** `Chart`.
    
- A `DashboardPage` **HAS-A** `StatCard`.
    

We need a component that can _contain_ other components.

---

##  New Component: `StatCard`

First, we need a simple component to show a single, important number.

- **What:** A `StatCard` is a `PageComponent` that displays a label and a large value. It's perfect for "Key Performance Indicators" (KPIs).
    

--
### How to use `StatCard`:

```java
// Create a StatCard with a label and a value
StatCard totalStudentsCard = new StatCard(
    "Total Students",  // The label
    "142"              // The value (as a String)
);

StatCard avgGpaCard = new StatCard(
    "Average GPA",
    "3.72"
);

// We can add this card directly to a page
myPage.add(totalStudentsCard);
```

---

##  New Component: `Panel`

But how do we add _multiple_ `StatCard`s and `Chart`s to one page in a nice grid?

- **What:** A `Panel` is a special `PageComponent` that acts as a **container**.
    
- It **IS-A** `PageComponent` (so you can add it to a `Page`).
    
- It **HAS-A** `PageComponent` (so you can add _other components_ to it).
    

**This is a perfect example of Composition.**

---

##  How to use `Panel`

The `Panel` constructor lets you easily create a grid.

```java
// Create a 2x2 grid Panel with 10-pixel gaps
// new Panel(rows, columns, horizontalGap, verticalGap)
Panel dashboardPanel = new Panel(2, 2, 10, 10);

// Now, we add our other components TO THE PANEL
dashboardPanel.add(totalStudentsCard);
dashboardPanel.add(avgGpaCard);
dashboardPanel.add(studentMajorChart);
dashboardPanel.add(studentYearChart);

// Finally, add the SINGLE dashboardPanel TO THE PAGE
dashboardPage.add(dashboardPanel);
```

##  Visualizing The "HAS-A" Structure

This is how our objects are _composed_:

- `myApp` (**HAS-A**) `Page` ("Dashboard")
    
    - `Page` ("Dashboard") (**HAS-A**) `Panel`
        
        - `Panel` (**HAS-A**) `StatCard` ("Total Students")
            
        - `Panel` (**HAS-A**) `StatCard` ("Average GPA")
            
        - `Panel` (**HAS-A**) `Chart` ("Majors")
            
        - `Panel` (**HAS-A**) `Chart` ("Years")
            

The `Panel` _owns_ and _arranges_ the four components inside it.

---

##  The Big Connection (OOP in Practice)

Our library uses _both_ "IS-A" and "HAS-A" at the same time!

### 1. We use "IS-A" (Polymorphism)

- `Chart` **IS-A** `PageComponent`
    
- `Panel` **IS-A** `PageComponent`
    
- `StatCard` **IS-A** `PageComponent`
    

**Why?** So the `Panel`'s `add()` method can accept any of them! The `Panel` doesn't care _what kind_ of component it is, only that it _is a_ `PageComponent`.

--
### 2. We use "HAS-A" (Composition)

- A `Panel` **HAS-A** list of `PageComponents`.
    

**Why?** To _build_ a complex component (our dashboard) from simpler parts.

---

##  Key Takeaways

### "IS-A" (Inheritance / Interface)

- **Purpose:** To define a _type_ or _contract_.
    
- **Use When:** You are specializing a concept. "A `Student` is a special _type_ of `Rowable`."
    
- **Enables:** Polymorphism.
    

--
### "HAS-A" (Composition / Aggregation)

- **Purpose:** To _build_ an object from _parts_.
    
- **Use When:** You are assembling a complex object. "A `Dashboard` _is built from_ charts and stat cards."
    
- **Enables:** Complex object construction and flexible layouts.
    

**Rule of Thumb:** Favor **Composition** over **Inheritance** when building objects. It's more flexible!

##  Programming Challenge: Student Profile

Let's use these new components to build something.

1. Create a new app with a single page named "Student Profile".
    
2. On this page, add a `Panel` with a **1 row, 2 column** layout.

--

3. **In the first (left) column:**
    
    - Add _another_ (nested) `Panel` with a **4 row, 1 column** layout.
        
    - Inside this nested panel, add four `StatCard`s:
        
        - "Name: Alice Smith"
            
        - "Major: Comp. Sci"
            
        - "Year: Sophomore"
            
        - "GPA: 3.8"
            
4. **In the second (right) column:**
    
    - Add a `Text` component.
        
    - In the text, write a short 2-3 sentence biography for Alice.
