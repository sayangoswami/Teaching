Most components will emphasize hands-on programming.\nHomework Assignments<br>\nProgramming requires consistent practice, so you will complete several assignments throughout the semester. These involve coding on a laptop or desktop computer. You may use your own device, borrow a Chromebook from the Library (first-come, first-served; semester-long loan due May 1 or December 1), or work on library desktop computers (Windows) available on the first and second floors. See the <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://library.smcm.edu/services/computers/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://library.smcm.edu/services/computers/\" target=\"_self\">SMCM library computing page</a> for details. Quizzes\nProgramming builds on many small concepts that fit together to form larger systems. To help you stay on track, there will be regular quizzes focused on these building blocks. Midterm Exam and Final Exam\nThese exams will assess your cumulative knowledge and problem-solving skills. Programming Project\nA larger-scale programming project will give you the opportunity to apply what you’ve learned in a more open-ended context. All quizzes and exams will be paper-based.Your final grade will be based on the following components:I will determine the exact letter-grade cutoffs at the end of the course. To ensure fairness, I guarantee the minimum grade you will receive based on your overall percentage:If adjustments are made to the grading scale, they will only raise your final letter grade, never lower it. The table below represents the lowest possible letter grade you can earn for a given percentage.I will publish the grades on Blackboard.Generative artificial intelligence (AI) (tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot) is a fast-developing tool that greatly impacts the learning process. As with many things, there are times when using these tools is appropriate and when it is not.&nbsp; For this course, I encourage you to use the generative AI tools at your disposal, including creating study guides or assisting with class assignments. However it is your responsibility to properly evaluate the information created through generative AI as well as explicitly cite its use within your assignments. We will discuss how to do this in class, and you should contact me with any questions that you may have if you encounter a situation where it is unclear how to do these citations. Failure to use the proper citation of generative AI tools may be considered plagiarism and will be handled via the SMCM Academic Misconduct policies.Attendance is not mandatory, and thus absence from class is not penalized directly, but you will lose out in other ways. Class attendance is the #1 indicator of academic success. OS3 emphatically encourages all students to Go To Class! Class attendance is important for numerous reasons:\nStudents tend to remember info more when they attend class.\nYour presence in class shows your instructor that you care about the course and it is important to you. If your grade is borderline at the end of the semester, the instructor may give you the benefit of the doubt because you regularly attended class.\nYou/your families are paying to be in class. In-state residents who miss a class are wasting over $56 per class. Out-of-state students who miss a class are throwing away $110 per class!\nYour instructor will likely explain material differently/better than you can learn it yourself, and can answer questions more directly.\nGoing to class helps you build community and relationships with peers and your instructors.\nBy not going to class, you may miss a pop quiz, participation points, extra credit opportunities, important info, or in-class assignments that can impact your grade.\nAssignments are due at 11:59 PM Eastern Time (UTC – 4) on the posted due date, with a one-hour grace period. Submissions received after that time will be subject to a late penalty of 1% of the maximum possible points per additional hour past the deadline. The minimum grade on any assignment is zero; late penalties will not reduce a score below this.Because the penalty accumulates continuously, assignments submitted several days late will earn little or no credit. Please plan accordingly and submit on time.This policy is designed to ensure fairness and to allow me to return graded work to the class within one week of the due date.The schedule below outlines our plan for the semester. As we move through the course, I may adjust the pace, spend more or less time on certain topics, or add/remove assignments and quizzes. These adjustments will be made with your learning in mind, to ensure you have the time and support needed to build a strong foundation in programming.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"COSC 120: COMPUTER SCIENCE I -  SYLLABUS","level":1,"id":"COSC_120_COMPUTER_SCIENCE_I_-_SYLLABUS_0"},{"heading":"Course Goals:","level":2,"id":"Course_Goals_0"},{"heading":"Learning outcomes:","level":2,"id":"Learning_outcomes_0"},{"heading":"Engaged Learning","level":2,"id":"Engaged_Learning_0"},{"heading":"SMCM Code of Student Conduct","level":2,"id":"SMCM_Code_of_Student_Conduct_0"},{"heading":"Academic Accommodations","level":2,"id":"Academic_Accommodations_0"},{"heading":"Office of Student Success Services","level":2,"id":"Office_of_Student_Success_Services_0"},{"heading":"Office of Title IX Compliance and Training","level":2,"id":"Office_of_Title_IX_Compliance_and_Training_0"},{"heading":"Wellness Center: Health Services and Counseling &amp; Psychological Services (CAPS)","level":2,"id":"Wellness_Center_Health_Services_and_Counseling_&_Psychological_Services_(CAPS)_0"},{"heading":"Evaluation Components","level":2,"id":"Evaluation_Components_0"},{"heading":"Grading","level":2,"id":"Grading_0"},{"heading":"Use of Generative AI","level":2,"id":"Use_of_Generative_AI_0"},{"heading":"Attendance Policy","level":2,"id":"Attendance_Policy_0"},{"heading":"Late Work Policy","level":2,"id":"Late_Work_Policy_0"},{"heading":"Tentative Schedule:","level":2,"id":"Tentative_Schedule_0"}],"links":["","mailto:sgoswami@smcm.edu","mailto:adasupport@smcm.edu","mailto:PASS@smcm.edu.","mailto:tutoring@smcm.edu.","mailto:os3@smcm.edu","mailto:jljolly@smcm.edu"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"teaching/cosc120/syllabus.html","pathToRoot":"../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1755175671249,"modifiedTime":1756816485998,"sourceSize":16288,"sourcePath":"Teaching/COSC120/Syllabus.md","exportPath":"teaching/cosc120/syllabus.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":0,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"teaching/cosc130/syllabus.html":{"title":"Syllabus","icon":"","description":"\nCredit hours: 4\nTerm and year: Fall 2025\nDelivery Mode Classroom\nWhen and Where: Tuesday, Thursday. 9:55 AM - 10:45 AM.

These adjustments will be made with your learning in mind, to ensure you have the time and support needed to build a strong foundation in programming.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"COSC 130: INTRO TO COMPUTER SCIENCE II -
