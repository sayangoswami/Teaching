Using Markdown with LaTeX is highly encouraged to ensure clarity in mathematical notation.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Quizzes Quizzes are short, low-stakes assessments designed to ensure you are keeping up with core concepts.

However it is your responsibility to properly evaluate the information created through generative AI as well as explicitly cite its use within your assignments. We will discuss how to do this in class, and you should contact me with any questions that you may have if you encounter a situation where it is unclear how to do these citations.
