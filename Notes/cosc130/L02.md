# Refresher: Loops and Arrays


## The `while` statement

```java
int n = 10;
while (n > 0) {
	System.out.println(n);
	n = n - 1;
}
System.out.println("Blastoff!");
```

- Almost reads like English!
- The expression in parentheses is called the *condition*. 
- The statements in braces are called the *body*. 


### How it works

- The flow of execution for a `while` statement is:
	1. Evaluate the condition, yielding `true` or `false`.
	2. If the condition is `false`, skip the body and go to the next statement.
	3. If the condition is `true`, execute the body and go back to step 1.
-  The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that, eventually, the condition becomes `false` and the loop *terminates*. 
- Otherwise the loop will repeat forever, which is called an **infinite loop**.


## Be the computer

What will the following program print:

```java
int n = 3;
while (n != 1) { 
	System.out.println(n); 
	if (n % 2 == 0) { 
		n = n / 2; 
	} else { 
		n = n * 3 + 1; 
	} 
} 
```



## The `for` loop

```java
int n = 10;
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i = i + 1) { 
	System.out.println(i);
}
```

`for` loops have three components in parentheses, separated by semicolons: the *initializer*, the *condition*, and the *update*.

1. The _initializer_ runs once at the very beginning of the loop.
2. The _condition_ is checked each time through the loop. If it is `false`, the loop ends. Otherwise, the body of the loop is executed (again).
3. At the end of each iteration, the _update_ runs, and we go back to step 2.


## Scope of initialized variable in for loop


```java
int n = 10;
for (int i = 0; i < n; i = i + 1) { 
	System.out.println(i);
}
System.out.println(i);  // error. i is not defined
```

If you declare a variable in the initializer, it *only exists inside* the `for` loop.


### Correct version

```java
int n = 10;
int i;
for (i = 0; i < n; i = i + 1) { 
	System.out.println(i);
}
System.out.println(i);  // this is ok
```


## The `do`-`while` loop

The `while` and `for` statements are *pretest* loops; they test the condition first and at the beginning of each pass through the loop.

The `do`-`while` is a *posttest* loop. Its useful when you need to run the body of the loop at least once.

```java
boolean more = true;  
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);  
do  {  
    // some business logic, such as add a transaction  
    addTransaction();
    System.out.println("Do you want to add another one.");  
    char ch = input.nextLine().charAt(0);  
    if (ch == 'N' || ch == 'n') more = false;  
} while (more);
```


## The `break` statement

When a program reaches a `break` statement, it exits the current loop.

```java
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);  
while (true) {  
    System.out.println("Enter amount: ");  
    int amount = input.nextInt();  
    if (amount < 0) {  
        System.out.println("Come back when you are serious.");  
        break;  
    }  
    System.out.println("Enter description: ");  
    String desc = input.next();  
    enterAmount(amount, desc);  
}
```


## The `continue` statement

A `continue` statement skips everything below it and moves on to the next iteration.

```java
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);  
int x = -1;  
int sum = 0;  
while (x != 0) {  
    x = in.nextInt();  
    if (x <= 0) {  
        continue;  
    }  
    System.out.println("Adding " + x);  
    sum += x;  
}
```



# Arrays


## The problem with variables

+  Variables can only store one value at a time.
+  What if we wanted to store many values at once
	+  declare many variables


### Example

Say, we have 25 students in a class, and we want to store all their scores.

```java
// declare 25 variables
int score0, score1, score2, score3, score4;
int score5, score6, score7, score8, score9;
int score10, score11, score12, score13, score14;
int score15, score16, score17, score18, score19;
int score20, score21, score22, score23, score24; 

// take 25 inputs from the user
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);  
score0 = in.nextInt();  
score1 = in.nextInt();  
score2 = in.nextInt();  
score3 = in.nextInt();  
score4 = in.nextInt();  
score5 = in.nextInt();  
score6 = in.nextInt();  
score7 = in.nextInt();  
score8 = in.nextInt();  
score9 = in.nextInt();  
score10 = in.nextInt();  
score11 = in.nextInt();  
score12 = in.nextInt();  
score13 = in.nextInt();  
score14 = in.nextInt();  
score15 = in.nextInt();  
score16 = in.nextInt();  
score17 = in.nextInt();  
score18 = in.nextInt();  
score19 = in.nextInt();  
score20 = in.nextInt();  
score21 = in.nextInt();  
score22 = in.nextInt();  
score23 = in.nextInt();  
score24 = in.nextInt();
```


What if we wanted to store the scores of **all students in the college**?



### The problem with variables (contd.)

What if we don't even know the number of students in advance?

```java
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);  
System.out.println("Enter the number of students: ");  
int n = input.nextInt();  
// how do we store n values now??
```


**Answer**: Use Arrays



## Array

+ A *data structure* is a collection of data organized so that you can perform operations on it *efficiently*.
+ An *array* is a type of data structure that can *hold multiple values under one common name*. 
+ Each value in an array assigned a unique number known as an *index*, which *starts from 0*.
+ A value can be *accessed* using the array name and index
+ Arrays are *mutable* (changeable), which means that once an array is created, the values of its elements can be changed.
+ Arrays must have a specified *type* and *size* (number of items that it stores).


## How to create an array

The syntax to declare an array is
```java
type[] name;
```

The syntax to actually create an empty array is
```java
name = new type[]
```

Example:
```java
int[] scores;
scores = new int[25];
```

+ What is the type of the elements in the array?
+ How many elements can this array store?


### Creating an array in one statement

Just like variables, the declaration and assignment can be done in the same statement.

```java
int[] scores = new int[25];
```


### Another example


```java
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);  
System.out.println("Enter the number of students: ");  
int n = input.nextInt();  
int[] scores = new int[25];
```

+ How many elements can this array store?
+ We can store any number of items, even though we don't know how many, in advance.


## How to access an array location (index)

The syntax to access an array element is
```java
name[index]
```

Example

```java
int[] scores = new int[25];
scores[0]; // this is the first grade
scores[24]; // this is the last grade
// scores[25] will throw an error
// scores[-1] will also throw an error
```

The array location `scores[0]` is equivalent to variable `score0` in the motivating example.


## How to modify an array element

The syntax to modify an array element is
```java
name[index] = value;
```

Example

```java
int[] scores = new int[25];
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);  
scores[0] = in.nextInt(); // get the first grade
grades[24] = in.nextInt(); // get the last grade
```

Again, `grade[0]` can be modified just like `grade0` in the motivating example.


## The array index can be a variable

```java
int[] scores = new int[25];
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
int i = 0;
scores[i] = in.nextInt(); // get the first grade
```


## The array index can also be an expression

```java
int[] scores = new int[25];
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
int i = 0;
scores[i+0] = in.nextInt(); // get the first grade
scores[i+1] = in.nextInt(); // get the second grade
scores[i+2] = in.nextInt(); // get the third grade
// ...
scores[i+24] = in.nextInt(); // get the last (25th) grade
```


## Storing the scores using an Array

```java
int[] scores = new int[25];  
Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

// input scores  
for (int i = 0; i < 25; i++) {  
    scores[i] = input.nextInt();  
}  
  
// print all the scores  
for (int i = 0; i < 25; i++) {  
    System.out.println(scores[i]);  
}
```


## Practice

Write a program that calculates and prints the average value of all the numbers in an array. Use loops to prompt the user for number of *elements* in the array and the elements themselves.
