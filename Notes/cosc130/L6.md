# CS2 Worksheet: Classes, Encapsulation, and Abstraction

---

This worksheet is designed to solidify your understanding of the foundational concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). We will move beyond classes as simple data holders and explore how they can be used to create robust and secure programs.

- **Classes & Objects:** A **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. An **object** is a specific instance of a class, with its own unique set of data.
    
- **Encapsulation:** This is the principle of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit (the class). It involves hiding the internal state of an object and requiring all interaction to happen through the object's public interface. The `private` keyword is key here.
    
- **Abstraction:** This is the concept of simplifying complexity. It means showing only the essential features of an object while hiding the unnecessary, complex details. A well-designed class provides a simple public interface for the user, abstracting away the underlying implementation.

### **Part 1: Defining a Class with Behavior**

--

**Problem 1**

Create a `Book` class. A book should have a `title` (String), an `author` (String), and a `pageCount` (int). It should also have a method called `getReadingTime` that calculates and returns the estimated reading time in minutes, assuming an average reading speed of 250 words per minute and an average of 300 words per page.

### **Part 2: Encapsulation**

--

**Problem 2**

Modify your `Book` class from Problem 1. Make all its fields (`title`, `author`, `pageCount`) **private**. This means they can only be accessed from within the class itself.

</div>


--

**Problem 3**

Now that your fields are private, external code can no longer access them directly. To fix this, you must provide a public interface. Add **getter** methods for each of your fields (`getTitle`, `getAuthor`, and `getPageCount`) so that other parts of the program can retrieve the values.

**Problem 4**

What is the benefit of making a field private and providing a public getter method instead of just making the field public?

</div>


--

**Problem 5**

Add a **setter** method named `setPageCount` to your `Book` class. This method should take an integer as a parameter. It must include a validation rule: the `pageCount` can only be set if the new value is greater than zero. If the new value is not valid, print an error message to the console. This demonstrates how encapsulation gives us control over our data.

### **Part 3: Abstraction**

--

**Problem 6:** Consider a `Car` class which has a `startEngine` method that contains a lot of complex logic. The user of the `Car` object doesn't need to know these details. This is *abstraction*. Fill in the blanks to define a `Car` class with a `startEngine` method. The `main` method should only interact with the simple public interface.

**Problem 8: Comprehensive Problem**

- Combine all the concepts you've learned to build a `SavingsAccount` class.
- The class should have a `balance` field and an `interestRate` field, both of type `double`.
- Both fields must be **private**.
- Provide a **public interface** with the following methods:
    - `deposit(double amount)`: Adds the amount to the balance. The amount must be greater than zero.
    - `withdraw(double amount)`: Subtracts the amount from the balance. The amount must be greater than zero and less than or equal to the current balance.
    - `addInterest()`: A method that updates the balance by adding the interest. This method hides the calculation logic from the user.

Once you have written the class, write a `main` method that demonstrates depositing money, withdrawing money, and then adding interest to the account.
