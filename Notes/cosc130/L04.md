# Refresher - Methods and Objects



## Welcome to the CS2 Refresher!

Welcome back! This module is a quick review of two of the most important concepts from CS1: **methods** and **objects**. We'll move quickly, so ask questions if anything is unclear.

**What we'll cover:**

- A deep dive into methods: parameters, return values, and overloading.
    
- What an object is and why we use them.
    
- Classes as blueprints for objects.
    
- Constructors, fields, and instance methods.
    


## Reviewing Methods: The Basics

A **method** is a named block of code that performs a specific task. You can think of it as a sub-routine that makes your code organized and reusable.

**Why use methods?**

- **Reusability:** Write code once, use it many times.
    
- **Organization:** Break a big problem into smaller, manageable chunks.
    
- **Readability:** Give descriptive names to blocks of code (e.g., `calculateTaxes()`).
    


## Anatomy of a Method

Let's look at the parts of a method definition.

```
public static int addNumbers(int num1, int num2) {
    int sum = num1 + num2;
    return sum;
}
```

- **`public static`**: Access modifiers. We'll explore these more, but `static` means it belongs to the class, not an object.
    
- **`int`**: The **return type**. It specifies the type of data the method sends back. Use `void` if the method doesn't return anything.


```
public static int addNumbers(int num1, int num2) {
    int sum = num1 + num2;
    return sum;
}
```
    
- **`addNumbers`**: The **method name**.
    
- **`(int num1, int num2)`**: The **parameters**. These are variables that act as placeholders for the data the method receives.
    
- **`{ ... }`**: The **method body**. All the code that the method executes goes in here.
    
- **`return sum;`**: The **`return` statement**. It sends the value back to the code that called the method.


## Parameters vs. Arguments

This is a key distinction.

- **Parameters**: The variable placeholders in a **method definition**.
    
- **Arguments**: The actual values passed to the method when it is **called**.
    

**Example:**

```java
// Definition: num1 and num2 are parameters
public static int add(int num1, int num2) { ... }

// Call: 10 and 5 are arguments
int result = add(10, 5);
```


## The `main` Method

The `main` method is the **entry point** of every Java application. It's the first method that runs when you execute a program.

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Your program starts here.
}
```

- It must be `public` and `static`.
    
- The return type is always `void` because it doesn't return a value.
    
- It always accepts a `String[]` (an array of strings) as an argument.


## Methods as "Black Boxes"

Think of a method as a **black box**. You provide it with some input (arguments), and it gives you a predictable output (return value) without you needing to know how it works inside.

**Example:**

- `Math.sqrt(25.0)`: You give it `25.0`, it gives back `5.0`. You don't need to know the complex algorithm it uses to find the square root.
    

This is a core principle of programming called **abstraction**.


## Method Overloading

**Method overloading** allows you to define multiple methods with the **same name** but different **parameters** in the same class. The compiler determines which method to call based on the arguments' number, type, and order.

**Example:**

```java
public static int add(int a, int b) { return a + b; }
public static double add(double a, double b) { return a + b; }
public static String add(String a, String b) { return a + b; }
```

When you call `add(5, 10)`, the `int` version is used. When you call `add(2.5, 3.5)`, the `double` version is used.


## The Transition to Objects

So far, we've focused on **procedural programming**. The program is a set of instructions (`main` method) that operates on data (variables).

**Problem:** What happens when our programs get bigger? We end up with long lists of methods that all operate on the same data.

**Solution:** **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**. We combine data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit called an **object**.


## What is an Object?

An **object** is a self-contained unit that has **state** and **behavior**.

- **State**: The data or properties of the object. These are stored in **fields** (variables).
    
- **Behavior**: The actions the object can perform. These are defined by **methods**.
    

**Analogy:** A car is an object.

- **State**: Color, make, model, speed.
    
- **Behavior**: `accelerate()`, `brake()`, `turnOn()`.
    


## Classes as Blueprints

A **class** is the blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the fields and methods that all objects of that type will have. You don't interact with the blueprint directly; you use it to build things.

**Analogy:**

- **Class:** The blueprint for a car. It specifies that all cars will have a color, a model, and methods like `accelerate()`.
    
- **Object:** A specific, physical car created from that blueprint (e.g., a "red Ford Mustang"). You can have many objects from the same class, each with its own unique state.


## Defining a Class

To define a class, you use the `class` keyword. Inside the class, you declare fields and methods.

```java
public class Dog {
    // Fields (State)
    String name;
    int age;

    // Methods (Behavior)
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}
```

This class defines a `Dog` object. Every `Dog` object we create from this blueprint will have a `name`, an `age`, and the ability to `bark()`.


## Creating an Object

You create an object from a class using the `new` keyword. This is also called **instantiating** an object.

**Syntax:** `ClassName objectName = new ClassName();`

**Example:**

```java
Dog myDog = new Dog();
```

- `myDog` is an **object variable** that holds a reference to a new `Dog` object.
    
- The `new Dog()` part creates the new object in memory.


## Accessing an Object's Fields and Methods

You use the **dot operator (`.`)** to access an object's fields and methods.

**Example:**

```java
Dog myDog = new Dog();

// Set the state of the object
myDog.name = "Fido";
myDog.age = 3;

// Call a method on the object
myDog.bark(); // Output: "Woof!"

System.out.println(myDog.name + " is " + myDog.age + " years old.");
// Output: "Fido is 3 years old."
```


## Exercise - creating a `Course` class

- Create a `Course` class with the `string` fields `code` and `title`. 
- Add a method called `print()` to print these fields.
- Create an object and assign the values `"COSC130"`, and `"INTRO TO COMPUTER SCIENCE II"` to the `code` and title `respectively`.
- Call the `print()` method of the object to print these fields.

## Constructors

A **constructor** is a special method used to **initialize** a new object. It's called automatically when you use the `new` keyword.

- A constructor has the same name as the class.
    
- It has **no return type** (not even `void`).


**Example:**

```java
public class Dog {
    String name;
    int age;

    // Constructor
    public Dog(String dogName, int dogAge) {
        name = dogName;
        age = dogAge;
    }
}
```


## Using a Constructor

Now, when we create a `Dog` object, we can provide the initial values directly.

```java
// Create a Dog object using the constructor
Dog myDog = new Dog("Fido", 3);

System.out.println(myDog.name); // Output: Fido
```

This is a much cleaner way to create and set up an object.

## The Default Constructor

If you don't provide any constructor, Java creates a **default constructor** for you. It's a constructor with no parameters that doesn't do anything.

```java
public class Dog {
    // No constructor defined
    String name;
}

// In main:
Dog myDog = new Dog(); // This works!
```

But once you create your own constructor, the default constructor is **no longer available**.


## `this` Keyword

Inside a class, the **`this` keyword** refers to the current object. It's often used to distinguish between a parameter and a field that have the same name.

**Example:**

```java
public class Dog {
    String name;
    int age;

    public Dog(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name; // refers to the object's name
        this.age = age;   // refers to the object's age
    }
}
```

This makes the code more concise and readable.


## Instance Methods

Methods defined inside a class are called **instance methods**. They operate on the specific object they are called on. They can access the object's fields directly.

```java
public class Dog {
    String name;

    public void bark() { // An instance method
        System.out.println(name + " says woof!");
    }
}

// In main:
Dog myDog = new Dog("Fido", 3);
myDog.bark(); // Output: Fido says woof!
```

When `myDog.bark()` is called, the `bark()` method knows to use `myDog`'s `name` field.


## Static Methods vs. Instance Methods

This is a common point of confusion.

- **Static Methods (`static`)**: Belong to the **class**, not a specific object. You call them using the class name (e.g., `Math.random()`). They **cannot** access instance fields.
    
- **Instance Methods (no `static`)**: Belong to a specific **object**. They can access the object's fields and methods. You must have an object to call them (e.g., `myDog.bark()`).
    


## The `toString()` Method

The `toString()` method is a special instance method that returns a `String` representation of an object. It's often used for debugging or printing objects.

- **Default behavior**: It prints a gibberish-looking string (e.g., `Dog@765f33f0`).
    
- **Good practice**: *Override* the `toString()` method to provide a meaningful string.
    

**Example:**

```java
@Override // This annotation is good practice
public String toString() {
    return "Dog[name=" + name + ", age=" + age + "]";
}
```



## The `toString()` in Action

Now, when you try to print your object, you get a clean output.

```java
Dog myDog = new Dog("Fido", 3);

System.out.println(myDog);
// Output: Dog[name=Fido, age=3]
```

The `println()` method automatically calls `toString()` if you pass it an object.


## Exercise: Creating a `Transaction` Class

Let's do a quick exercise to refresh these concepts.

**Problem:** Create a class called `Transaction`.

- It should have fields for `description` (String), `date` (String), and `amount` (double).
    
- It should have a constructor to initialize these fields.
    
- override the `toString` method to display the transaction information in a clear format.

## Review of Object Concepts

- **Class**: The blueprint.
    
- **Object**: An instance of a class.
    
- **Fields**: The data (state) of an object.
    
- **Methods**: The actions (behavior) of an object.
    
- **Constructor**: A special method to create and initialize an object.
    
- **`new`**: The keyword used to create an object.
    
- **`this`**: Refers to the current object.
    
- **Dot operator (`.`)**: Used to access an object's fields and methods.
    


## Passing Objects to Methods

You can pass objects to methods as arguments. This is a powerful way to share and manipulate data.

**Example:**

```java
public void giveShot(Dog dog) { 
	System.out.println(dog.name + " got a shot!"); 
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Vet myVet = new Vet();
    Dog myDog = new Dog("Fido", 3);
    myVet.giveShot(myDog); // Passing the myDog object
}
```


## Pass-by-Value (for objects)

In Java, arguments are always **passed by value**. For primitive types (`int`, `double`), the value is copied. For objects, the **reference** to the object is copied.

- If you change the object's state inside the method (e.g., `dog.age = 4`), the change **persists** outside the method.
    
- You **cannot** change the object reference itself to point to a new object.
    



## What's Next?

This review sets the stage for core topics of this course.

- **Encapsulation**: Using access modifiers (`private`, `public`) to hide an object's internal state.
    
- **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing ones.
    
- **Polymorphism**: The ability of an object to take on many forms.
    
- **Interfaces**: Defining a contract for a class.
    

These topics are the next logical steps in your journey to mastering object-oriented programming.
