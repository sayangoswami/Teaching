## Recap

To declare an array variable:
```java
int[] scores;
```

To create an empty array and store in an array-variable

```java
scores = new int[25];
```

To do both in the same line
```java
int [] scores
scores = new int[25];
```



## Recap

To access (read/write) an array element:
```java
int i = 10;
scores[i] = scores[i-1] + scores[i+1];
```



## Lab 1: Array of random integers

Write a program that takes an integer $n$ and then creates an $n$-length array of random integers between 0 and 100. Use `random.nextInt(100)` to get a random number between 0 and 100. Print the integers.


## Lab 2: Pretty-Printing

Modify the previous program so that it prints the array elements in the following format:
`[12, 30, 43, 83, 19]`



## Lab 3: Reverse array

Create an array $A$ of random integers like before. Create another array $B$ that has the same elements as array $A$ but in reverse order. Print the elements of $B$.


## Lab 4: Histogram of grades

Create a array $A$ of random integers between 1 and 100. Create another array $C$ of size 10 that stores a histogram (of equal-size buckets) of the numbers in $A$. Print the histogram.
