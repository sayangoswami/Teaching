# Object-Oriented Designs

## What is Object-Oriented Programming?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects." 

It helps us *model real-world problems* by treating parts of our programs as self-contained entities, or *objects*.

---

## The Four Pillars of OOP

The four pillars of OOP are:

1. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods.
    
2. **Abstraction**: Hiding complexity.
    
3. **Inheritance**: Creating new classes from existing ones.
    
4. **Polymorphism**: The ability of an object to take on many forms.
    

Now, we will focus on the first two: Encapsulation and Abstraction.

## Encapsulation: The Idea of a Capsule

Think of a pill capsule. It holds all the medicine inside. You don't need to know the individual ingredients or how they work together; you just take the capsule.

**Encapsulation** in programming is the same idea: it's the **bundling of data and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit.**

---

## Why Use Encapsulation?

Encapsulation protects data from accidental modification. 

It provides a controlled interface for interacting with an object, preventing outside code from directly accessing or changing the data. 

This is crucial for maintaining data integrity.

---

## Encapsulation in a Simple Example

Let's use a simple example: a **`BankAccount`** object.

Without encapsulation, anyone could change the balance directly, which is dangerous.

```java
// Not encapsulated
public class BankAccount {
    public double balance;
}

// In another class...
BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
account.balance = -100; // Oops, this shouldn't be allowed!
```

---

## Encapsulation with Getters and Setters

To encapsulate the data, we make the `balance` variable **`private`**. We then provide **public** methods—a **`get`** method to read the balance and a **`set`** method to modify it.

```java
public class BankAccount {
    private double balance; // Data is private

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
    public void deposit(double amount) { // A method to change the data
        if (amount > 0) {
            balance += amount;
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Encapsulation in Action

With encapsulation, we control how the data is changed. We can add **validation** to our `deposit` method to ensure the amount is positive.

```java
// In another class...
BankAccount account = new BankAccount();
account.deposit(500); // OK
account.deposit(-100); // Invalid, the method won't allow it!
```

This is a small example of how encapsulation protects our data and prevents errors.

---

## Encapsulation Analogy: Your TV Remote

Your TV remote is a perfect analogy for encapsulation. 
- The buttons on the remote (the public methods) are the only way you can change the channel or volume. 
- You don't need to know how the remote's internal circuits (the private data) work. You just press the button and get a result.

---

## Abstraction: The Big Picture

**Abstraction** is the process of **hiding the complex implementation details** and showing only the essential features of an object. 

It focuses on **what** an object does, not **how** it does it.

---

## Abstraction in Real Life

Think about driving a car. 

You know how to use the steering wheel, pedals, and gear shift. 

You don't need to know the detailed mechanics of how the engine works, how the fuel is ignited, or how the transmission changes gears. 

Abstraction hides all that complexity from you.

---

## Abstraction in a Simple Example

Let's continue with our `BankAccount` example.

When you use the `deposit()` method, you don't need to know the specific lines of code that run. You just call the method and trust that it will increase the balance. The internal logic is abstracted away.

```java
// Abstraction in action
BankAccount myAccount = new BankAccount();
myAccount.deposit(500); // You don't see the code: balance += amount;
```

---

## Encapsulation vs. Abstraction

This is often where students get confused! Let's clarify.

- **Encapsulation** is about **internal** hiding. It keeps the data and methods together in a "capsule" to protect the data.
    
- **Abstraction** is about **external** hiding. It simplifies the object's interface and hides the complex internal details from the user.
    
---

## An Analogy to Differentiate

Think about a smartphone.

- **Encapsulation**: The screen, processor, and battery are all bundled inside the phone's case. You can't just reach in and touch the circuits. This is encapsulation.
    
- **Abstraction**: You use a simplified interface (the apps and touch screen) to interact with the phone. You don't need to understand the underlying code or hardware that makes the apps work. This is abstraction.
