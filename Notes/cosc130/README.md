These "Notes" are just slides I use in class, and thus are not comprehensive. Eventually, my plan is to make them more like notes. If you would like to contribute material (**with attribution**) such as add your own notes or annotations or exercise solutions, please come talk to me.

**The slides I use in class are not in an accessible format**, but if you still want to view them, click on the following link: [link to my slides which are not accessible](https://liascript.github.io/course/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sayangoswami/Teaching/main/Notes/cosc130/Slides.md). The content is the same, its just the format that differs.
