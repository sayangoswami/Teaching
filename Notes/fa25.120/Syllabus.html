<h2 id="course-goals">Course Goals</h2>
<p>This course aims to introduce students to the foundational principles of computer science and provide a practical, hands-on introduction to programming using the Java language. The course is designed to empower students to think algorithmically and solve simple problems using an object-oriented approach. It also seeks to provide a broad overview of the key fields within computer science and their real-world relevance.</p>
<h2 id="learning-outcomes">Learning outcomes</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to: - <strong>Summarize</strong> the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). - <strong>Write</strong> basic Java programs that use variables, methods, and control flow structures. - <strong>Implement</strong> a class with appropriate fields and methods to model a real-world object. - <strong>Utilize</strong> built-in data-structures to store and manage a collection of objects. - <strong>Analyze</strong> a simple program to identify potential logic errors or bugs. - <strong>Design</strong> and <strong>construct</strong> a complete, object-oriented program from a given class diagram to solve a practical problem.</p>
<h2 id="engaged-learning">Engaged Learning</h2>
<p>The Engaged Learning component will emphasize teamwork in solving programming problems. Together in class, we will finalize the format of this activity, and with my guidance, you will help choose the problems your teams will work on.</p>
<h2 id="smcm-code-of-student-conduct">SMCM Code of Student Conduct</h2>

<h2 id="evaluation-components">Evaluation Components</h2>
<p>Your course grade will be based on homework assignments, quizzes, a midterm exam, a final exam, and a programming project. Most components will emphasize hands-on programming.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Homework Assignments</strong><br />
Programming requires consistent practice, so you will complete several assignments throughout the semester. These involve coding on a laptop or desktop computer. You may use your own device, borrow a <strong>Chromebook</strong> from the Library (first-come, first-served; semester-long loan due May 1 or December 1), or work on <strong>library desktop computers</strong> (Windows) available on the first and second floors. See the <a href="https://library.smcm.edu/services/computers/">SMCM library computing page</a> for details.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quizzes</strong><br />
Programming builds on many small concepts that fit together to form larger systems. To help you stay on track, there will be regular quizzes focused on these building blocks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Midterm Exam</strong> and <strong>Final Exam</strong><br />
These exams will assess your cumulative knowledge and problem-solving skills.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Programming Project</strong><br />
A larger-scale programming project will give you the opportunity to apply what you’ve learned in a more open-ended context.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All quizzes and exams will be paper-based.</strong></p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Your final grade will be based on the following components:</p>
<table>

<p>I will determine the exact letter-grade cutoffs at the end of the course. To ensure fairness, I guarantee the <em>minimum</em> grade you will receive based on your overall percentage:</p>
<p>If adjustments are made to the grading scale, they will only <strong>raise</strong> your final letter grade, never lower it.</p>
<p>The table below represents the lowest possible letter grade you can earn for a given percentage.</p>

<p><strong>I will publish the grades on Blackboard</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="use-of-generative-ai">Use of Generative AI</h2>
<p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI) (tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot) is a fast-developing tool that greatly impacts the learning process. As with many things, there are times when using these tools is appropriate and when it is not.  For this course, <em>I encourage you to use the generative AI tools</em> at your disposal, including creating study guides or assisting with class assignments. However it is your responsibility to properly evaluate the information created through generative AI as well as <em>explicitly cite its use within your assignments</em>. We will discuss how to do this in class, and you should contact me with any questions that you may have if you encounter a situation where it is unclear how to do these citations. Failure to use the proper citation of generative AI tools may be considered plagiarism and will be handled via the SMCM Academic Misconduct policies.</p>
<h2 id="attendance-policy">Attendance Policy</h2>
<p>Attendance is not mandatory, and thus absence from class is not penalized directly, but you will lose out in other ways. Class attendance is the #1 indicator of academic success. OS3 emphatically encourages all students to Go To Class! Class attendance is important for numerous reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students tend to remember info more when they attend class.</li>
<li>Your presence in class shows your instructor that you care about the course and it is important to you. If your grade is borderline at the end of the semester, the instructor may give you the benefit of the doubt because you regularly attended class.</li>
<li>You/your families are paying to be in class. In-state residents who miss a class are wasting over $56 per class. Out-of-state students who miss a class are throwing away $110 per class!</li>
<li>Your instructor will likely explain material differently/better than you can learn it yourself, and can answer questions more directly.</li>
<li>Going to class helps you build community and relationships with peers and your instructors.</li>
<li>By not going to class, you may miss a pop quiz, participation points, extra credit opportunities, important info, or in-class assignments that can impact your grade.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="late-work-policy">Late Work Policy</h2>
<p>Assignments are due at <strong>11:59 PM Eastern Time (UTC – 4)</strong> on the posted due date, with a one-hour grace period. Submissions received after that time will be subject to a late penalty of <strong>1% of the maximum possible points per additional hour</strong> past the deadline. The minimum grade on any assignment is zero; late penalties will not reduce a score below this.</p>
<p>Because the penalty accumulates continuously, assignments submitted several days late will earn little or no credit. Please plan accordingly and submit on time.</p>
<p>This policy is designed to ensure fairness and to allow me to return graded work to the class within one week of the due date.</p>
<h2 id="tentative-schedule">Tentative Schedule</h2>
<p>The schedule below outlines our plan for the semester. As we move through the course, I may adjust the pace, spend more or less time on certain topics, or add/remove assignments and quizzes. These adjustments will be made with your learning in mind, to ensure you have the time and support needed to build a strong foundation in programming.</p>
