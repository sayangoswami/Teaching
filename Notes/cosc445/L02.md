# Algorithm analysis




## The RAM Model of computation

- Hypothetical computer called the Random Access Machine

- Each simple operation ($+$, $\times$, $-$, $=$, `if`, `call`) takes exactly one time step.

- Loops and subroutines are not considered simple operations. Instead, they are the composition of many single-step operations.

- Each memory access takes exactly one time step. Infinite memory. No memory hierarchy

- Count the number of steps an algorithm takes on a given instance of a problem. That give us the runtime in RAM


## Complexity

- To understand how good or bad an algorithm is in general, we must know how it works over all possible instances.

![600](fig/02.01.svg)



- The _worst case complexity_ of an algorithm is the function defined by the maximum number of steps taken on any instance of size _n_.

- The _best case complexity_ of an algorithm is the function defined by the minimum number of steps taken on any instance of size _n_.

- The _average-case complexity_ of the algorithm is the function defined by an average number of steps taken on any instance of size _n_.

- Each of these complexities defines a numerical function: time vs. size!



- Generally speaking, we will use the *worst-case complexity as our preferred measure* of algorithm efficiency. 

- Worst-case analysis is generally *easy to do, and "usually" reflects the average case*.  When we refer to complexity of an algorithm, always assume we are talking about the worst-case, unless otherwise specified!

- *Randomized algorithms* are of growing importance, and require an average-case type analysis to show off their merits.



## The Big-Oh notation

- Best, worst, and average case are difficult to deal with because the _precise_ details are very complicated.
	- May have bumps on some inputs.
	- Require too much detail to specify precisely, can't be done without actually implementing it.

- It easier to talk about _upper and lower bounds_ of the function. Asymptotic notation ($\mathcal{O}$, $\mathcal{\Omega}$, ${} \mathcal{\Theta}$) are as well as we can practically deal with complexity functions.

- $g(n) = \mathcal{O}(f(n))$ means $cf(n)$ is an upper bound on $g(n)$

- $g(n) = \mathcal{\Omega}(f(n))$ means $cf(n)$ is a lower bound on $g(n)$

- $g(n) = \mathcal{\Theta}(f(n))$ means $c_{1}f(n)$ is an upper bound on $g(n)$ and $c_{2}f(n)$ is a lower bound on $g(n)$

- $c$, $c_{1}$, $c_{2}$ are all constants independent of _n_.



- The Big Oh notation ignores the difference between multiplicative constants.

	- $f(n) = n$ and $g(n) = 2n$ are identical in big-oh analysis

- Furthermore, we arbitrarily choose a constant $n_{0}$ beyond which the upper or lower bounds are satisfied. We do not care about small values of $n$.

- $f(n) = \mathcal{O}(g(n))$ if there are positive constants $n_{0}$ and $c$ such that to the right of $n_{0}$, the value of $f(n)$ always lies on or below $c.g(n)$



![](fig/02.04.svg)
- $f(n) = \mathcal{\Omega}(g(n))$ if there are positive constants $n_{0}$ and $c$ such that to the right of $n_{0}$, the value of $f(n)$ always lies on or above $c.g(n)$



![](fig/02.05.svg)

- $f(n) = \mathcal{\Theta}(g(n))$ if there exist positive constants $n_{0}, c_{1}, c_{2}$ such that to the right of $n_{0}$, the value of $f(n)$ always lies between $c_{1}.g(n)$ and $c_{2}.g(n)$ inclusive.


## Big $\mathcal{O}$ examples

- $f(n) = 3n^{2} - 100n + 6 = \mathcal{O}(n^{2})$

	- $c =$ 
	
	- $n_{0} =$

- $f(n) = 3n^{2} - 100n + 6 = \mathcal{O}(n^{3})$

	- $c =$ 
	
	- $n_{0} =$

- $f(n) = 3n^{2} - 100n + 6 \neq \mathcal{O}(n)$

Think of the equality as meaning _in the set of functions_.


## Big $\mathcal{\Omega}$ examples


- $f(n) = 3n^{2} - 100n + 6 = \mathcal{\Omega}(n^{2})$

	- $c =$ 
	
	- $n_{0} =$

- $f(n) = 3n^{2} - 100n + 6 = \mathcal{\Omega}(n)$

	- $c =$ 
	
	- $n_{0} =$

- $f(n) = 3n^{2} - 100n + 6 \neq \mathcal{\Omega}(n^{3})$


## Big $\mathcal{\Theta}$ examples


- $f(n) = 3n^{2} - 100n + 6 = \mathcal{\Theta}(n^{2})$

	- $c =$ 
	
	- $n_{0} =$

- $f(n) = 3n^{2} - 100n + 6 \neq \mathcal{\Theta}(n)$

- $f(n) = 3n^{2} - 100n + 6 \neq \mathcal{\Theta}(n^{3})$


## Is $2^{n+1} = \mathcal{\Theta}(2^{n})$?




## Is $(x+y)^{2} = \mathcal{O}(x^{2} + y^{2})$?






## Big $\mathcal{O}$ addition and subtraction

- Suppose $f(n) = \mathcal{O}(n^{2})$ and $g(n) = \mathcal{O}(n^{2})$

- $f(n) + g(n) = \mathcal{O}(\_\_\_\_\_?)$

- $f(n) - |g(n)| = \mathcal{O}(\_\_\_\_\_?)$

- $f(n) + g(n) = \mathcal{\Theta}(max(f(n), g(n)))$


## Big $\mathcal{O}$ multiplication by constant


- $\mathcal{O}(c.f(n)) = \mathcal{O}(f(n))$

- $\mathcal{\Omega}(c.f(n)) = \mathcal{O}(f(n))$

- $\mathcal{\Theta}(c.f(n)) = \mathcal{O}(f(n))$


## Big $\mathcal{O}$ multiplication by function

- $\mathcal{O}(f(n)).\mathcal{O}(g(n)) = \mathcal{O}(f(n).g(n))$

- $\mathcal{\Omega}(f(n)).\mathcal{\Omega}(g(n)) = \mathcal{\Omega}(f(n).g(n))$

- $\mathcal{\Theta}(f(n)).\mathcal{\Theta}(g(n)) = \mathcal{\Theta}(f(n).g(n))$

## Testing Asymptotic Dominance

$f(n)$ dominates $g(n)$ if $\lim_{ n \to \infty } \frac{g(n)}{f(n)} = 0$

This is the same as saying $g(n) = \mathcal{O}(f(n))$



## Examples: 

1. $n^{2}$ vs $2n^{2}$
2. $n^{2}$ vs $n^{3}$
3. $n^{2}$ vs $n^{1.9}$
4. $3^{n}$ vs $2^{n}$





## Dominance rankings

Commonly encountered functions:

$n! \gg 2^{n} \gg n^{3} \gg n^{2} \gg n\log n \gg n \gg \log n \gg 1$

Some more esoteric functions:

$c^{n} \gg n^{3} \gg n^{2} \gg n^{1+\epsilon} \gg n\log n \gg n \gg \sqrt{ n } \gg \log ^{2}n \gg \log n$
