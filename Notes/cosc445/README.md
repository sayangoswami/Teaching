If you want to view the notes as slides (not accessible), then clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/sayangoswami/Teaching.git`

and then visit https://liascript.github.io/course/ and import the `Notes/COSC445` folder.

Suggestions and changes are welcome. If you would like to contribute material, add your notes or annotations or exercise solutions, please come talk to me.
