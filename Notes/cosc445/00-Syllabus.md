## Course Goals

This course studies the design, implementation and analysis of important algorithms. Topics include lower and upper complexity bounds, algorithm analysis techniques, NP-completeness, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, graph algorithms, divide-and-conquer algorithms, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, backtracking, probabilistic algorithms, and mathematical algorithms.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Analyze the *best-case*, *average-case*, and *worst-case asymptotic performance* of algorithms using standard notations (Big-O, $\Omega$, $\Theta$).

- Construct *correctness proofs* for algorithms using techniques such as *loop invariants and mathematical induction*.

- Compare and contrast major algorithms and data structures (such as sorting, graph traversal, and hashing) to determine their suitability for specific computational problems.

- Apply key algorithmic design paradigms, including *divide-and-conquer*, *dynamic programming*, and *greedy* strategies, to solve complex problems.

- Synthesize efficient algorithms for engineering design situations and validate their performance through theoretical analysis and empirical testing.

- Categorize computational problems into *complexity classes* (P, NP, NP-Complete) and identify when a problem is likely to be *computationally intractable*.

## Engaged Learning

The Engaged Learning component will include problem solving and readings.

## Evaluation Components

Your course grade will be based on homework assignments, quizzes, a midterm exam, and a final exam. All components will emphasize algorithm design and problem-solving.

- **Homework Assignments:** Homework is the primary vehicle for learning in this course. These sets will involve:
	- Algorithm Design: Developing efficient solutions to complex engineering problems.
	- Proofs: Providing mathematical justification (e.g., loop invariants, induction) for algorithm correctness.
	- Complexity Analysis: Determining the asymptotic bounds (e.g., $O(n \log n)$) of your proposed solutions.
	- *Note:* Submission must be through pdf files, and *must be typed (not hand written)*. Using Markdown with LaTeX is highly encouraged to ensure clarity in mathematical notation.

- **Quizzes** Quizzes are short, low-stakes assessments designed to ensure you are keeping up with core concepts. These will focus on "familiarity" tasks, such as tracing a specific algorithm (like Dijkstra’s or Quicksort) on a provided data set or identifying the complexity class of a given function.

- **Midterm Exam** and **Final Exam** Exams will test your ability to synthesize the paradigms learned in class under time constraints.
	- The Midterm covers foundational analysis, sorting, and divide-and-conquer.
	- The Final Exam is cumulative but will heavily emphasize dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and graph theory.

**Important**: All quizzes and exams will be paper-based.

## Grading

Your final grade will be based on the following components:

| Component    | Weight |
| ------------ | ------ |
| Assignments  | 20%    |
| Quizzes      | 20%    |
| Midterm exam | 30%    |
| Final exam   | 30%    |

I will determine the exact letter-grade cutoffs at the end of the course. To ensure fairness, I guarantee the _minimum_ grade you will receive based on your overall percentage:

If adjustments are made to the grading scale, they will only **raise** your final letter grade, never lower it.

The table below represents the lowest possible letter grade you can earn for a given percentage.

| Points    | Letter Grade |
| --------- | ------------ |
| 93 - 100  | A or higher  |
| 86 - 92.9 | A- or higher |
| 79 - 85.9 | B+ or higher |
| 72 - 78.9 | B or higher  |
| 65 - 71.9 | B- or higher |
| 58 - 64.9 | C+ or higher |
| 51 - 57.9 | C or higher  |
| 44 - 50.9 | C- or higher |
| 37 - 43.9 | D+ or higher |
| 30 - 36.9 | D or higher  |
| 0 - 29.9  | F or higher  |

The grades would be published on Blackboard.

## Use of Generative AI

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) (tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot) is a fast-developing tool that greatly impacts the learning process. As with many things, there are times when using these tools is appropriate and when it is not.  For this course, *I encourage you to use the generative AI tools* at your disposal, including creating study guides or assisting with class assignments. However it is your responsibility to properly evaluate the information created through generative AI as well as *explicitly cite its use within your assignments*. We will discuss how to do this in class, and you should contact me with any questions that you may have if you encounter a situation where it is unclear how to do these citations. Failure to use the proper citation of generative AI tools may be considered plagiarism and will be handled via the SMCM Academic Misconduct policies.

## Attendance Policy

Attendance is not mandatory, and thus absence from class is not penalized directly, but you will lose out in other ways. Class attendance is the #1 indicator of academic success. OS3 emphatically encourages all students to Go To Class! Class attendance is important for numerous reasons:

- Students tend to remember info more when they attend class.

- Your presence in class shows your instructor that you care about the course and it is important to you. If your grade is borderline at the end of the semester, the instructor may give you the benefit of the doubt because you regularly attended class.

- You/your families are paying to be in class. In-state residents who miss a class are wasting over $56 per class. Out-of-state students who miss a class are throwing away $110 per class!

- Your instructor will likely explain material differently/better than you can learn it yourself, and can answer questions more directly.

- Going to class helps you build community and relationships with peers and your instructors.

- By not going to class, you may miss a pop quiz, participation points, extra credit opportunities, important info, or in-class assignments that can impact your grade.

## Late Work Policy

Assignments are due at **11:59 PM Eastern Time (UTC – 4)** on the posted due date, with a one-hour grace period. Submissions received after that time will be subject to a late penalty of **10% of the maximum possible points per additional day** past the deadline. The minimum grade on any assignment is zero; late penalties will not reduce a score below this.

Because the penalty accumulates continuously, assignments submitted several days late will earn little or no credit. Please plan accordingly and submit on time.

This policy is designed to ensure fairness and to allow me to return graded work to the class within two weeks of the due date.

## Tentative Schedule:

The schedule below outlines our plan for the semester. As we move through the course, I may adjust the pace, spend more or less time on certain topics, or add/remove assignments and quizzes. These adjustments will be made with your learning in mind, to ensure you have the time and support needed to build a strong foundation.
