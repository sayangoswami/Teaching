# Introduction to Creative Coding

## Part 1: Hello, Processing!

Welcome to the world of creative coding with *Processing*! Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. We'll be using the Java version of Processing.

### Your First Sketch

In Processing, a program is called a "sketch." Let's create our first one. The window that opens when you run a sketch is your canvas.

Every sketch has two main parts: `setup()` and `draw()`.

- `setup()`: This code runs **once** when your sketch starts. It's used for initialization, like setting the size of your canvas.
    
- `draw()`: This code runs **repeatedly** in a loop, creating animations.
    

Let's draw a simple circle. Run the following code using the **(</>)** button below it.

```java
void setup() {
  // Set the size of our canvas to 400x400 pixels
  size(400, 400);
}

void draw() {
  // Draw a circle (ellipse) at x=200, y=200 with a width and height of 50
  ellipse(200, 200, 50, 50);
}
```
@Processing.eval

**Coordinates in Processing:**

The top-left corner is `(0, 0)`. The x-values increase to the right, and y-values increase downwards.

### Challenge:

- Can you change the `size()` of the canvas?
    
- Can you change the position and size of the `ellipse()`?
    
- Try drawing a `rect(x, y, width, height)` or a `line(x1, y1, x2, y2)`.

```java
void setup() {
  // Set the size of our canvas to 400x400 pixels
  size(400, 400);
}

void draw() {
  // Draw a circle (ellipse) at x=200, y=200 with a width and height of 50
  ellipse(200, 200, 50, 50);
}
```
@Processing.eval

---

## Part 2: What are Variables?

Imagine you want to draw a circle in the middle of your screen. If your canvas is 400x400, the middle is at (200, 200). What if you change the canvas size to 600x600? You'd have to find all the places you used `200` and change them to `300`. That's where variables come in.

A **variable** is a container for storing data values.

### Declaring and Initializing Variables

In Java, you must declare a variable's type. For numbers, we often use `int` for integers (whole numbers).

```java
// <type> <name> = <value>;
int x = 200;
int y = 200;
int diameter = 100;

void setup() {
  size(400, 400);
}

void draw() {
  // Now we use the variable names instead of the numbers
  ellipse(x, y, diameter, diameter);
}
```
@Processing.eval

Now, if you want to change the circle's properties, you only need to change the values of the variables at the top.

### Common Data Types

- `int`: integers (e.g., `5`, `-10`, `0`)
    
- `float`: floating-point numbers (e.g., `3.14`, `-0.5`)
    
- `boolean`: `true` or `false`
    
- `char`: single characters (e.g., `'a'`, `'!'`)
    
- `String`: text (e.g., `"Hello, world!"`)
    

### Challenge:

Create variables for the position and size of a rectangle and use them to draw it.

```java








```
@Processing.eval

---

## Part 3: Processing's Built-in Variables

Processing provides some handy built-in variables that are always available to you. These can make your sketches more dynamic.

### `width` and `height`

Instead of hard-coding the dimensions of your canvas, you can use the `width` and `height` variables. These automatically hold the width and height you set in `size()`.

Let's draw a circle in the exact center of the canvas, no matter the size.

```java
void setup() {
  size(600, 400); // Try changing these values!
}

void draw() {
  // background() clears the screen each frame
  background(240); // A light gray

  // Center of the canvas is (width/2, height/2)
  int centerX = width / 2;
  int centerY = height / 2;

  ellipse(centerX, centerY, 100, 100);
}
```
@Processing.eval

### `mouseX` and `mouseY`

These variables store the current horizontal (`mouseX`) and vertical (`mouseY`) coordinates of the mouse cursor.

```java
void setup() {
  size(500, 500);
}

void draw() {
  background(200);

  // The ellipse will follow your mouse!
  ellipse(mouseX, mouseY, 50, 50);
}
```
@Processing.eval

### Challenge:

Draw a line that connects the top-left corner of the canvas to your mouse cursor.

```java








```
@Processing.eval

---

## Part 4: What are Expressions?

An **expression** is a combination of values, variables, and operators that computes to a new value. You've already used them! `width / 2` is an expression.

### Arithmetic Operators

Java has the standard arithmetic operators you'd expect:

- `+` (addition)
    
- `-` (subtraction)
    
- `*` (multiplication)
    
- `/` (division)
    

Let's use expressions to draw a simple character.

```java
int headSize = 100;
int eyeSize = 20;

void setup() {
  size(400, 400);
}

void draw() {
  background(220);

  // Head in the center
  ellipse(width/2, height/2, headSize, headSize);

  // Left eye - position is relative to the center
  ellipse(width/2 - 25, height/2 - 10, eyeSize, eyeSize);

  // Right eye
  ellipse(width/2 + 25, height/2 - 10, eyeSize, eyeSize);

  // Mouth
  rect(width/2 - 20, height/2 + 20, 40, 10);
}
```
@Processing.eval

Notice how the eye and mouth positions are calculated relative to the center of the canvas. This is a powerful technique!

### Challenge:

Add a nose to the character using expressions to position it correctly.

```java








```
@Processing.eval

## Part 5: Order of Operations

Just like in math class, Java has an order of operations. It's often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS/BODMAS:

1. **P**arentheses `()`
    
2. **E**xponents (we'll cover these later)
    
3. **M**ultiplication `*` and **D**ivision `/` (from left to right)
    
4. **A**ddition `+` and **S**ubtraction `-` (from left to right)
    

Consider this: `int result = 5 + 3 * 2;`

Multiplication happens first, so `3 * 2` is `6`. Then `5 + 6` is `11`. `result` will be `11`.

If we want to do the addition first, we use parentheses: `int result = (5 + 3) * 2;`

Now, `5 + 3` is `8`, and `8 * 2` is `16`. `result` will be `16`.

```java
void setup(){
  size(400, 100);
  background(200);
  
  int x1 = 50;
  int y = 50;
  int spacing = 10;
  int size = 20;

  // This will draw the circles far apart
  ellipse(x1 + spacing * 5, y, size, size);

  // This will draw the circles closer
  ellipse((x1 + spacing) * 2, y, size, size);
}

void draw(){} // We can leave draw empty if nothing is animating
```
@Processing.eval

### Challenge:

Create a variable `x`. Draw three circles on the screen. The first at `x`, the second at `x + 50`, and the third at `x + 100`. Use expressions to calculate the positions.

```java








```
@Processing.eval

---

## Part 6: `int` vs. `float` and Type Conversion

So far, we've mostly used `int` for whole numbers. But what about division?

`int result = 5 / 2;`

In integer division, the result is also an integer. Java truncates (chops off) the decimal part. So, `result` will be `2`, not `2.5`.

### The `float` type

If you need decimal precision, use the `float` data type. To make a number a `float`, add an `f` at the end.

```java
float result = 5.0f / 2.0f; // result is 2.5
```

If you divide an `int` by a `float` (or vice-versa), Java will "promote" the `int` to a `float` for the calculation, and the result will be a `float`.

```java
float x = width / 2.0f; // Good! This gives a precise center.
int y = height / 2;    // Also fine for center calculation.
```

### Type Casting

You can force a value to a different type. This is called **casting**.

```java
int a = 5;
int b = 2;
float result = (float)a / b; // Cast 'a' to a float before dividing. result is 2.5
```

This is useful when you have integer variables but need a floating-point result from their division.

### Challenge:

Draw a line that goes from the left edge of the screen to `1/3` of the way across the screen. Use a `float` and casting to get an accurate position.


```java








```
@Processing.eval

---

## Part 7: More Assignment Operators

You already know the basic assignment operator `=`.

`int x = 10;`

Java provides shorthand operators for modifying a variable's value.

Let's say we want to increase `x` by `5`. We could write: `x = x + 5;`

Or, we can use the `+=` operator: `x += 5; // This does the exact same thing!`

### Shorthand Operators

- `+=` (addition assignment)
    
- `-=` (subtraction assignment)
    
- `*=` (multiplication assignment)
    
- `/=` (division assignment)
    

### Increment and Decrement

There are even shorter operators for adding or subtracting 1.

`x++;` is the same as `x = x + 1;` or `x += 1;` `x--;` is the same as `x = x - 1;` or `x -= 1;`

These are very common in loops, which we will see later.

Let's make a circle move across the screen.

```java
int x = 0;

void setup() {
  size(400, 200);
}

void draw() {
  background(200);
  ellipse(x, height/2, 50, 50);

  // Move the circle to the right each frame
  x++;
}
```
@Processing.eval

### Challenge:

Make the circle move faster. What happens when it goes off the screen?


```java








```
@Processing.eval

---

## Part 8: Generating Random Numbers

Predictability is useful, but sometimes we want our sketches to have an element of surprise. The `random()` function is perfect for this.

`random(high)`: Returns a random `float` between `0` and `high` (exclusive of `high`). 

`random(low, high)`: Returns a random `float` between `low` and `high`.

Run the following program multiple times to see and example of the effect of `random()`

```java
float x, y, diameter;

void setup() {
  size(500, 500);

  // Generate random properties once in setup
  x = random(width);
  y = random(height);
  diameter = random(20, 100);
  
  println("x:", x, "y:", y, "diameter:", diameter);
}

void draw() {
  // Draw the same random circle each frame
  ellipse(x, y, diameter, diameter);
}
```
@Processing.eval


If you call `random()` inside `draw()`, you'll get a new random number every frame, creating a flickering effect.

```java
void setup() {
  size(500, 500);
}

void draw() {
  // New random gray background each frame
  background(random(255));
}
```
@Processing.eval

### Challenge:

Create a sketch that draws a new circle at a random position with a random size every time you click the mouse. (Hint: Look up the `mousePressed()` function in the Processing reference).


```java








```
@Processing.eval

---

## Part 9: Mapping Values with `map()`

A very common task in creative coding is to take a value from one range and map it to another. For example, you might want the color of a shape to change as the mouse moves from left to right.

The `mouseX` variable goes from `0` to `width`. Color values for grayscale often go from `0` (black) to `255` (white). The `map()` function does this conversion for us.

The syntax is: `map(value, start1, stop1, start2, stop2)`

- `value`: the incoming value to be converted (e.g., `mouseX`)
    
- `start1`, `stop1`: the lower and upper bounds of the value's current range (e.g., `0`, `width`)
    
- `start2`, `stop2`: the lower and upper bounds of the target range (e.g., `0`, `255`)
    

```java
void setup() {
  size(500, 500);
}

void draw() {
  // Map mouseX from its range [0, width] to the grayscale range [0, 255]
  float grayValue = map(mouseX, 0, width, 0, 255);
  
  background(grayValue);

  // We can map another value for the circle size
  // As mouseY goes from top to bottom, size goes from 20 to 200
  float circleSize = map(mouseY, 0, height, 20, 200);
  ellipse(width/2, height/2, circleSize, circleSize);
}
```
@Processing.eval

### Challenge:

Map the `mouseY` to control the red component of a color, and `mouseX` to control the blue component. Use the `fill(red, green, blue)` function.


```java








```
@Processing.eval

## Part 10: Review and Putting It All Together

Let's review the key concepts we've covered:

- **Variables**: Named containers for data (`int`, `float`).
    
- **Built-in Variables**: `width`, `height`, `mouseX`, `mouseY`.
    
- **Expressions**: Combinations of values, variables, and operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
    
- **Order of Operations**: PEMDAS.
    
- **Type Conversion**: `int` vs `float`, and casting with `(float)`.
    
- **Assignment Operators**: `+=`, `-=`, `++`, `--`.
    
- **Functions**: `random()` for unpredictability and `map()` for scaling values.
    

By combining these simple ideas, you can create complex and interactive sketches.

### Example: A Simple Solar System

```java
float angle = 0;
float orbitRadius = 150;

void setup() {
  size(500, 500);
}

void draw() {
  background(10, 20, 40); // Dark blue space

  // Sun in the center
  fill(255, 200, 0); // Yellow
  ellipse(width/2, height/2, 100, 100);

  // Calculate planet's position using trigonometry (we'll cover this later!)
  // For now, just see how expressions can create movement.
  float planetX = width/2 + cos(angle) * orbitRadius;
  float planetY = height/2 + sin(angle) * orbitRadius;

  // Planet
  fill(0, 100, 255); // Blue
  ellipse(planetX, planetY, 30, 30);
  
  // Update angle for next frame to make it orbit
  angle += 0.02f;
}
```
@Processing.eval

This example is a bit advanced, but it shows how variables (`angle`) and expressions are used every frame in `draw()` to update the state of your sketch and create animation.

You now have the fundamental building blocks for creating visual and interactive art with code. Congratulations!

## Assignment: Static Flower Drawing

Your task is to write a Processing sketch that draws a flower. The flower must be drawn relative to a single point defined by two variables, `flowerX` and `flowerY`. This means if you change the values of `flowerX` and `flowerY`, the entire flower should move without changing its shape.

### Requirements:

Your sketch **MUST** include the following:

1. **Canvas Size**: The canvas must be exactly `500` pixels wide and `500` pixels high.
    
2. **Variables**:

    - `int flowerX = 250;`
        
    - `int flowerY = 250;`
        
    - `int petalSize = 100;`
        
    - `int stemHeight = 150;`
        
3. **Drawing**:

    - **Stem**: A green rectangle for the stem. Its top-center should be at `(flowerX, flowerY)`. Its height must be controlled by `stemHeight`.
        
    - **Center**: A yellow circle for the center of the flower, centered at `(flowerX, flowerY)`. Its size should be half of `petalSize`.
        
    - **Petals**: Exactly four light-blue petals.
        
        - Each petal must be a circle.
            
        - The size of each petal must be controlled by `petalSize`.
            
        - The petals must be positioned around the center (top, bottom, left, right). Their positions must be calculated using `flowerX`, `flowerY`, and an expression involving `petalSize`.
            

### Grading Checks:

We will test and grade your code by:

1. Running your sketch with the initial variable values.
    
2. Changing `flowerX` to `100` and `flowerY` to `400` and re-running. The entire flower must move to the new location.
    
3. Changing `petalSize` to `50` and re-running. The flower's petals and center must resize correctly relative to each other.
    

### Example Submission Code:

Fill in the `...` parts in the starter code below. Submit your code in Blackboard.

```java
void setup() {
  size(500, 500);
}

void draw() {
  background(230); // A light gray background

  int flowerX = 250;
  int flowerY = 250;
  int petalSize = 100;
  int stemHeight = 150;

  // --- YOUR CODE GOES BELOW ---

  // Stem (Green)
  fill(0, 150, 0);
  // ... draw the stem rectangle ...

  // Petals (Light Blue)
  fill(173, 216, 230);
  // ... draw the four petal ellipses ...

  // Flower Center (Yellow)
  fill(255, 255, 0);
  // ... draw the center ellipse ...
}
```
@Processing.eval

Good luck!

## Assignment Rubric: Static Flower Drawing

This rubric outlines how the assignment will be graded. The assignment is worth a total of 100 points.

- **(15 points)** **Canvas Size**:
    
    - `15 pts`: `size(500, 500);` is present and correct in `setup()`.
        
    - `0 pts`: Canvas size is incorrect.
        
- **(20 points)** **Variable Declaration**:
    
    - `20 pts`: All four required variables (`flowerX`, `flowerY`, `petalSize`, `stemHeight`) are declared correctly with their initial values.
        
    - `10 pts`: Some variables are missing or have incorrect initial values.
        
    - `0 pts`: Most or all required variables are missing.
        
- **(25 points)** **Relativity - Position**:
    
    - `25 pts`: When `flowerX` and `flowerY` are changed, the _entire_ drawing (all petals, center, and stem) moves as a single unit to the new location.
        
    - `15 pts`: Some parts of the flower move correctly, but others do not.
        
    - `0 pts`: The flower does not move, or its shape becomes distorted when `flowerX` and `flowerY` are changed.
        
- **(25 points)** **Relativity - Size**:
    
    - `25 pts`: When `petalSize` is changed, all four petals and the flower's center resize correctly and maintain their relative positions. The center must be half the size of the petals.
        
    - `15 pts`: Petals resize, but the center does not, or their relative positions are incorrect.
        
    - `0 pts`: The flower's components do not resize correctly.
        
- **(15 points)** **Component Correctness**:
    
    - `15 pts`: The sketch draws a green stem, a yellow center, and exactly four light-blue petals, as specified.
        
    - `10 pts`: Some components are missing, have incorrect shapes, or incorrect colors.
        
    - `0 pts`: Major components are missing or incorrect.
