# Programming Worksheet: Loops (Paired Problems)

**Instructions:** For each pair of problems, I will code the solution for the "My Problem." Your task is to use the same logic and patterns to solve the "Your Problem" on your own.

---

### Pair 1: `for` Loop Calculations

**1A: My Problem**

Write a for loop that prints the first 10 multiples of 3 (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30).

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code below ...
    }
}
```
@LIA.java(Main)

**1B: Your Problem**

Write a for loop that prints the first 10 multiples of 5 (5, 10, 15... up to 50).

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code below ...
    }
}
```
@LIA.java(Main)

---

### Pair 2: User-Controlled `for` Loop

**2A: My Problem**

Ask the user for a number n. Then, using a for loop, print a single line containing n asterisk characters (*).

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code below ...
    }
}
```
@LIA.java(Main)

**2B: Your Problem**

Ask the user for a number n and a character c. Then, using a for loop, print a single line containing n copies of the character c.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code below ...
    }
}
```
@LIA.java(Main)

---

### Pair 3: `while` Loop for Input Validation

**3A: My Problem**

Write a while loop that repeatedly asks the user "Enter a positive number:" until the user enters a number that is greater than 0.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code below ...
    }
}
```
@LIA.java(Main)

**3B: Your Problem**

Write a while loop that repeatedly asks the user "Enter a number between 1 and 10:" until the user enters a number that is $\ge 1$ AND $\le 10$.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code below ...
    }
}
```
@LIA.java(Main)

---

### Pair 4: Accumulator with a Condition

**4A: My Problem**

Write a for loop that calculates and prints the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 20 (i.e., $2 + 4 + 6 + ... + 20$).

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code below ...
    }
}
```
@LIA.java(Main)

**4B: Your Problem**

Write a for loop that calculates and prints the sum of all odd numbers between 1 and 20 (i.e., $1 + 3 + 5 + ... + 19$).

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code below ...
    }
}
```
@LIA.java(Main)

---

### Pair 5: Accumulator (Product)

**5A: My Problem**

Ask the user for a number n. Using a loop, calculate 2 raised to the power of n ($2^n$). (e.g., if $n=3$, $1 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8$).

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code below ...
    }
}
```
@LIA.java(Main)

**5B: Your Problem**

Ask the user for two numbers: base and exponent. Using a loop, calculate base raised to the power of exponent.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code below ...
    }
}
```
@LIA.java(Main)

---

### Pair 6: String Looping and Accumulating

**6A: My Problem**

Ask the user for a word (e.g., "Java"). Use a for loop to print each character of the word on a new line. (Hint: use word.charAt(i)).

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code below ...
    }
}
```
@LIA.java(Main)

**6B: Your Problem**

Ask the user for a word (e.g., "Hello"). Use a for loop to build and print the word in reverse (e.g., "olleH").

(Hint: Loop backwards from word.length() - 1 down to 0).

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code below ...
    }
}
```
@LIA.java(Main)

### Pair 7: `while` Loop Simulation

**7A: My Problem**

Simulate a bank account. Start with a balance of \$1000. In a while loop, keep subtracting $80 (for "bills") each "month" (loop iteration) and print the new balance. Stop when the balance is no longer high enough to pay the bill (i.e., when balance $< 80$).

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code below ...
    }
}
```
@LIA.java(Main)

**7B: Your Problem**

Simulate a phone battery. Start with a charge of 100%. In a while loop, keep subtracting 7% each "hour" (loop iteration) and print the current charge. Stop when the charge is 10% or less (and print "Low Battery!").

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code below ...
    }
}
```
@LIA.java(Main)

---

### Pair 8: Accumulator for Averaging

**8A: My Problem**

Use a for loop to ask the user to enter 5 test scores. After the loop, calculate and print the average of those scores.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code below ...
    }
}
```
@LIA.java(Main)

**8B: Your Problem**

First, ask the user how many test scores they want to enter (n). Then, use a for loop to ask for n scores. After the loop, calculate and print the average of those scores.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code below ...
    }
}
```
@LIA.java(Main)

---

### Pair 9: Accumulator for Finding Min/Max

**9A: My Problem**

Ask the user to enter 5 numbers. Write a loop that finds and prints the largest number entered. (Hint: Create a variable max and update it inside the loop if you find a bigger number).

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code below ...
    }
}
```
@LIA.java(Main)

**9B: Your Problem**

Ask the user to enter 5 numbers. Write a loop that finds and prints the smallest number entered.

(Hint: This is very similar, but you'll need a min variable and will check for a smaller number).

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code below ...
    }
}
```
@LIA.java(Main)

---

### Pair 10: Loop with Modulo Operator

**10A: My Problem**

Write a for loop that loops from 1 to 50. Print every number that is divisible by 7. (Hint: num % 7 == 0).

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code below ...
    }
}
```
@LIA.java(Main)

**10B: Your Problem**

Write a for loop that loops from 1 to 50. Print every number that is divisible by both 3 and 5.

(Hint: You'll need && in your if statement).

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Your code below ...
    }
}
```
@LIA.java(Main)
