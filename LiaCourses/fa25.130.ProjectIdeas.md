# Project Options

Here are three project options. Each project requires you to use the GUI library to build a complete application. The core of your grade will be based on how you use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to structure your application.

## Project 1: Personal Finance Tracker

**Description:** Create a desktop application to track your personal income and expenses. The application should allow you to enter new transactions and see a dashboard overview of your financial health.

**Core Components to Use:**

- **"Add Transaction" Page (`Form`):** A form to add a new transaction.

    - **Fields:** `Date` (String), `Description` (String), `Category` (String), `Type` (String - "Income" or "Expense"), `Amount` (double).

- **"All Transactions" Page (`Table`):** A table that shows a list of all transactions added.

- **"Dashboard" Page (`Panel`):** A main dashboard page that shows:

    - **`StatCard` 1:** Current Balance (Total Income - Total Expenses).

    - **`StatCard` 2:** Total Income.

    - **`StatCard` 3:** Total Expenses.

    - **`Chart` 1:** A **Pie Chart** showing expenses broken down by `Category`.

    - **`Chart` 2:** A **Bar Chart** showing Total Income vs. Total Expenses.


**Key OOP Requirements:**

1. **`Transaction` Class:** You must create a `Transaction` class that implements the `Rowable` interface. It will store the data for a single transaction (date, description, etc.).

2. **`AddTransactionHandler` Class:** You must create a class that implements `FormSubmitHandler` to process the data from your `Form`, create a new `Transaction` object, and add it to your main `ArrayList` of transactions.

3. **Dynamic Dashboard:** The `StatCard`s and `Chart`s on your dashboard must be _dynamic_. They must read their data from your `ArrayList` of transactions and update automatically as new transactions are added.

<!-- data-type="none" data-sortable="false" -->
|Criteria (100 points)|Description|Points|
|---|---|---|
|**1. OOP Data Model**|`Transaction` class is well-defined, has appropriate fields, and correctly implements the `Rowable` interface.|20|
|**2. Interface Implementation**|`AddTransactionHandler` class correctly implements the `FormSubmitHandler` interface and successfully creates `Transaction` objects.|20|
|**3. CRUD Functionality**|The `Form` correctly adds new transactions. The `Table` correctly displays all transactions from the `ArrayList`.|25|
|**4. Dashboard Implementation**|The dashboard `Panel` is laid out clearly. All `StatCard`s and `Chart`s are present and _dynamically_ calculate their values from the data.|25|
|**5. Code Quality & Style**|Code is clean, well-commented, and uses good variable names. The application is easy to understand and runs without errors.|10|

## Project 2: Simple Inventory Manager

**Description:** Create an application for a small store to track its product inventory. The application should allow a user to add new products and see a dashboard overview of the store's inventory.

**Core Components to Use:**

- **"Add Product" Page (`Form`):** A form to add a new product to the inventory.

    - **Fields:** `ProductID` (String), `Name` (String), `Category` (String), `Quantity` (int), `Price` (double).

- **"Inventory" Page (`Table`):** A table that shows a list of all products in the inventory.

- **"Dashboard" Page (`Panel`):** A main dashboard page that shows:

    - **`StatCard` 1:** Total # of Products (count of unique items).

    - **`StatCard` 2:** Total Value of Inventory (sum of `Quantity * Price` for all items).

    - **`Chart` 1:** A **Pie Chart** showing the number of products broken down by `Category`.

    - **`Chart` 2:** A **Bar Chart** showing the `Quantity` of the 5-10 most-stocked items.
        

**Key OOP Requirements:**

1. **`Product` Class:** You must create a `Product` class that implements the `Rowable` interface. It will store the data for a single product (ID, name, etc.).

2. **`AddProductHandler` Class:** You must create a class that implements `FormSubmitHandler` to process the data from your `Form`, create a new `Product` object, and add it to your main `ArrayList` of products.

3. **Dynamic Dashboard:** The `StatCard`s and `Chart`s on your dashboard must be _dynamic_. They must read their data from your `ArrayList` of products and update automatically as new products are added.

## Project 3: Fitness & Calorie Tracker

**Description:** Create an app to log your daily meals and exercises. The app will help you track your net caloric intake and see a dashboard summary of your activities.

**Core Components to Use:**

- **"Log Entry" Page (`Form`):** A form to add a new entry.

    - **Fields:** `Date` (String), `Description` (String), `Type` (String - "Meal" or "Exercise"), `Category` (String - e.g., "Breakfast", "Running"), `Calories` (int).

- **"Daily Log" Page (`Table`):** A table that shows a list of all meals and exercises added.

- **"Dashboard" Page (`Panel`):** A main dashboard page that shows:

    - **`StatCard` 1:** Net Calories (Total Meal Cals - Total Exercise Cals).

    - **`StatCard` 2:** Total Calories Eaten (sum of "Meal" types).

    - **`StatCard` 3:** Total Calories Burned (sum of "Exercise" types).

    - **`Chart` 1:** A **Pie Chart** showing calories eaten by `Category` (e.g., "Breakfast", "Lunch", "Dinner").

    - **`Chart` 2:** A **Bar Chart** showing calories burned by `Category` (e.g., "Running", "Lifting", "Biking").
        

**Key OOP Requirements:**

1. **`LogEntry` Class:** You must create a `LogEntry` class that implements the `Rowable` interface. It will store the data for a single log entry.

2. **`AddEntryHandler` Class:** You must create a class that implements `FormSubmitHandler`. It will process the form data, create a new `LogEntry` object, and add it to your main `ArrayList` of entries.

3. **Dynamic Dashboard:** The `StatCard`s and `Chart`s on your dashboard must be _dynamic_, performing calculations on your `ArrayList` of `LogEntry` objects (e.g., looping through to sum up values based on `Type`).

## Bonus Features (For Extra Credit)

Looking to go above and beyond? Try adding one of these features to your project.

1. **"Update" Functionality:** Use the `Table`'s `addRowSelectionListener` to detect when a user clicks a row. When clicked, show the item's details in a `Text` component or even a new pre-filled `Form` to allow editing. (This is advanced!)
    
2. **"Delete" Functionality:** Add a "Delete Selected Item" button to your `Table` page. Use `table.getSelectedRowIndex()` to find the selected row, remove the corresponding object from your `ArrayList`, and then re-create the `Table` to show the change.
    
3. **Complex Layouts:** Use the `Panel` component to _nest_ layouts. For example, have a main 2-column `Panel`, and put _another_ `Panel` inside one of those columns to arrange 4 `StatCard`s in a grid.
    
4. **Data Persistence (Advanced):** Use `java.io.File` and `java.io.PrintWriter` to save your `ArrayList` data to a `.csv` file when the app closes and `java.util.Scanner` to read it back in when the app starts.
