# Assignment: The Disproportionate Outcomes Modeler

## Project Inquiry

This assignment explores the concept of **justice as proportional representation**. We will use code to simulate a simple political or legal process (like jury selection, resource allocation, or law enforcement contact) and introduce a subtle, non-explicit **systemic bias**. Your task is to run the simulation many times, analyze the resulting data using arrays and loops, and quantify whether the system is statistically **just** or **unjust**.

**Focus:** Modeling a system where two population groups (Group A and Group B) have unequal access to an outcome (e.g., selection, opportunity, or protection), even if the bias is hidden deep within the system's "rules."

---

## I. Technical Requirements & Setup

### 1. Variables and Constants

We use the `final` keyword to declare that a variable's value will not change, i.e., we essentially make it a *constant*.

1.  Define a constant for the total number of simulation trials: `final int TOTAL_TRIALS = 100000;`
2.  Define the population distribution:

    - `final double POP_GROUP_B_PERCENT = 0.25;` (25% of the population belongs to Group B)
3.  Define the **Systemic Bias** constant (a crucial input to the simulation):

    - `final double BIAS_ADVANTAGE_GROUP_A = 0.05;` (Group A has a 5% advantage in the selection process).
4.  Initialize two integer counters (`int`) to track the outcomes: `groupASelections` and `groupBSelections`.

### 2. The Simulation Loop

Create a **`for` loop** that runs `TOTAL_TRIALS` times. Inside the loop, you must first determine if the current individual being processed belongs to Group A or Group B, and then run the selection logic.

1.  **Determine Group Membership:** Use `Math.random()` to determine the individual's group. (Since Group B is 25%, if `Math.random() < POP_GROUP_B_PERCENT`, the individual is Group B; otherwise, they are Group A).
2.  **The Biased Selection Logic (Conditionals):**

    * Inside the loop, determine if the individual is "selected" (e.g., picked for the jury, or receives a resource). We simulate this selection with a second call to `Math.random()`.
    * **Selection for Group A:** If the individual is Group A, they are selected if `Math.random() < (0.50 + BIAS_ADVANTAGE_GROUP_A)`. (They have a 55% chance).
    * **Selection for Group B:** If the individual is Group B, they are selected if `Math.random() < 0.50`. (They have a 50% chance).
    * If selected, increment the appropriate counter (`groupASelections` or `groupBSelections`).

---

## II. Analysis and Report

After the simulation loop completes, perform the following analysis:

1.  **Calculate Expected Percentages:**

    * The **Expected Selection Percentage** for Group A is the same as its population percentage (75%).
    * The **Expected Selection Percentage** for Group B is the same as its population percentage (25%).
2.  **Calculate Actual Percentages (Using Accumulators):**

    * Calculate the total number of selections (`totalSelections = groupASelections + groupBSelections`).
    * Calculate the **Actual Selection Percentage** for Group A: `(groupASelections / totalSelections) * 100`.
    * Calculate the **Actual Selection Percentage** for Group B.
    * Make sure you perform *`double`-division* in the previous steps, else the division would yield a 0.
3.  **Conclusion (Justice Evaluation):**

    * Print the expected vs. actual selection percentages for both groups.
    * Use a final **`if/else` block** to evaluate the statistical justice of the system.
    * **The Test:** If the **Actual Selection Percentage** of **Group B** is less than $90\%$ of its **Expected Selection Percentage** (i.e., less than $0.90 \times 25\% = 22.5\%$), conclude that the system is **statistically unjust** due to disproportionate outcomes. Otherwise, conclude the system is **statistically just**.
    * Run the code multiple times and change `BIAS_ADVANTAGE_GROUP_A` to find the *smallest bias percentage* (percentage of advantage in selection process) that *consistently produces disproportionate outcomes*.

## III. Grading Rubric (25 Points)

<!-- data-type="none" data-sortable="false" -->
| Criteria | Points | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Setup & Variables** | 5 | Constants (`TOTAL_TRIALS`, `POP_GROUP_B_PERCENT`, `BIAS_ADVANTAGE_GROUP_A`) and necessary counters are correctly initialized. |
| **Group Membership Logic** | 5 | Correct use of `Math.random()` and conditionals to accurately assign individuals to Group A (75%) or Group B (25%) based on population constants. |
| **Bias/Selection Loop** | 6 | A single `for` loop runs `TOTAL_TRIALS` times. The **biased selection logic** (the $5\%$ advantage for Group A) is correctly implemented and outcomes are tallied. |
| **Analysis & Calculation** | 5 | Correct calculation of **Actual Selection Percentages** for both groups based on the raw counts from the simulation. |
| **Justice Evaluation** | 4 | Final `if/else` block correctly implements the $90\%$ threshold test and prints a clear, definitive conclusion (`Statistically Just` vs. `Statistically Unjust`). |
| **Total** | **25** | |
