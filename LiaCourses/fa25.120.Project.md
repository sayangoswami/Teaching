# **Project: "Critter Garden" (A Bouncing Ball Simulation)**

### Project Concept

The goal is to create a dynamic digital "garden" or "aquarium" where multiple "critters" (represented by simple circles) move and live. Each critter will have its own position, speed, and color. They will move around the screen and "bounce" off the walls, creating a continuous, generative animation.

This project is a classic in creative coding and is the perfect way to combine arrays and loops. We will use **parallel arrays** to keep track of all the data for our critters.

### Core Requirements

Your Processing sketch must meet these requirements:

1. **`setup()` Function:**

    - Set a screen size (e.g., `size(800, 600);`).        
    - Define the number of critters you want with a single variable (e.g., `int numCritters = 50;`).
    - **Declare and initialize your arrays.** You will need **parallel arrays** for all the critter properties. For example:

      - `float[] xPos = new float[numCritters];`            
      - `float[] yPos = new float[numCritters];`
      - `float[] xSpeed = new float[numCritters];`
      - `float[] ySpeed = new float[numCritters];`
      - `color[] critterColors = new color[numCritters];` (Processing has a built-in `color` type!)

    - Use a **`for` loop** to iterate from `0` to `numCritters - 1` and:

      - Give each critter a random starting position (`xPos[i]` and `yPos[i]`).            
      - Give each critter a random speed (`xSpeed[i]` and `ySpeed[i]`).
      - Give each critter a random color (`critterColors[i]`).

2. `draw()` Function:

    - Draw a background (e.g., `background(0);`).        
    - Use a single **`for` loop** that iterates from `0` to `numCritters - 1`. Inside this loop, you will do three things for `each` critter `i`:

        1. **Update Position:**

            - `xPos[i] = xPos[i] + xSpeed[i];`                
            - `yPos[i] = yPos[i] + ySpeed[i];`

        2. **Check for Bouncing (Conditionals):**

            - Use `if` statements to check if the critter has hit a wall.                
            - If `xPos[i]` is greater than `width` or less than `0`, reverse the x-speed: `xSpeed[i] = xSpeed[i] * -1;`.
            - Do the same for the `yPos[i]`, `height`, and `ySpeed[i]`.

        3. **Draw the Critter:**

            - Set the fill color: `fill(critterColors[i]);`                
            - Draw the circle: `circle(xPos[i], yPos[i], 20);`
                

### Processing Tips

Remember the following:

1. You don't need a `main` method in processing code. Processing provides `void setup() { ... }` and `void draw() { ... }`.
2. `setup()` runs **once** when the program starts.
3. `draw()` runs **repeatedly** in a loop (about 60 times per second), creating the animation.
4. Helpful functions:

    - `size(width, height);`
    - `background(grayscale);` or `background(red, green, blue);`
    - `fill(r, g, b);`
    - `circle(x, y, diameter);`
    - `random(low, high);`
    - `width` and `height` are built-in variables that store the screen dimensions.
    - `mouseX` and `mouseY` are built-in variables that store the mouse position.


### Going Further (For Bonus Points)

- Make the critter's size random using another array (`float[] diameters = ...`).
- When a critter hits a wall, have it change to a new random color.
- Add interactivity: If the mouse is pressed, have all critters move _away_ from the mouse cursor. To check if the mouse is pressed, used the **`mousePressed()`** method. [Details here.](https://processing.org/reference/mousePressed_.html)
- Change the critter's speed based on its `y` position (e.g., "gravity").

| Criteria (Category)                                      | 0-1 points (Missing)                                | 2-3 points (Needs Work)                                                  | 4-5 points (Excellent)                                                                                              | Score    |

| **Array Initialization**<br><br>  <br><br>(in `setup()`) | No arrays are used.                                 | Arrays are declared but not properly initialized in a loop.              | Parallel arrays are correctly declared and all values are initialized inside a `for` loop (position, speed, color). | /5       |
| **Loop-Driven Drawing**<br><br>  <br><br>(in `draw()`)   | Critters are not drawn, or are drawn manually.      | A loop is used, but it does not correctly update and draw all critters.  | A single `for` loop correctly iterates through all arrays to update positions and draw all critters.                | /5       |
| **Conditional Bouncing**<br><br>  <br><br>(in `draw()`)  | Critters do not bounce and fly off-screen.          | Bouncing logic is attempted but is buggy (e.g., critters get "stuck").   | `if` statements correctly detect all 4 wall collisions and reverse the appropriate speed variable.                  | /5       |
| **Program Functionality**                                | Program does not run or has major errors.           | Program runs, but the animation is broken or does not meet requirements. | Program runs flawlessly, producing a smooth, continuous animation of 50+ bouncing critters.                         | /5       |
| **Code Quality & Style**                                 | Code is unformatted, unreadable, and not commented. | Code is functional but poorly formatted or lacks comments.               | Code is clean, well-indented, and uses comments and good variable names (`numCritters`, `xPos`, etc.)               | /5       |
| **Total**                                                |                                                     |                                                                          |                                                                                                                     | **/ 25** |
