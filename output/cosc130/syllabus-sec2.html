</ul>
<p>This course examines object-oriented design and programming in
greater detail. An examination of the use of the data structures
provided by language-specific libraries, and some common simple
algorithms. Students learn to design and implement simple applications.
The emphasis of this course is on learning good design. This course is
suitable for non-majors who want to improve their ability to solve
problems using programs.</p>
</section>
<section id="learning-outcomes" class="level2">
<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design and implement</strong> object-oriented programs in
Java that integrate encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and
interfaces.</li>
<li><strong>Analyze</strong> and <strong>debug</strong> Java programs to
trace execution, identify errors, and improve correctness.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluate</strong> alternative design choices (e.g.,
composition vs inheritance, abstract classes vs interfaces) and justify
trade-offs.</li>
<li><strong>Create</strong> a medium-scale Java project that
demonstrates sound object-oriented design principles.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="engaged-learning" class="level2">
<h2>Engaged Learning</h2>
<p>The Engaged Learning component will emphasize teamwork in solving
programming problems. Together in class, we will finalize the format of
this activity, and with my guidance, you will help choose the problems
your teams will work on.</p>

<h2>Wellness Center: Health Services and Counseling &amp; Psychological
Services (CAPS)</h2>
<p>A growing number of students are experiencing mental health
challenges to varying degrees. Doing what you can to stay ahead by
wisely taking care of yourself will be a key to succeeding
academically.  Sometimes mental health challenges can affect your
ability to complete required work. For example, a particular assignment
might trigger anxiety for you in ways which were not anticipated. Or,
maybe it becomes difficult to attend class due to mental health
challenges. In any of those cases please come and talk with more or send
me an email.  I’ll listen and do what I can to help. The sooner you
share your challenges with me, the better prepared I am to assist you. 
I am one of many people here at SMCM who care about you and your
welfare. For further support, the Wellness Center provides numerous
confidential health and counseling services including same day/next day
connections to counseling by calling 240-895-4289 or emailing the

<section id="evaluation-components" class="level2">
<h2>Evaluation Components</h2>
<p>Your course grade will be based on homework assignments, quizzes, a
midterm exam, a final exam, and a programming project. Most components
will emphasize hands-on programming.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Homework Assignments</strong> - Programming requires
consistent practice, so you will complete several assignments throughout
the semester. These involve coding on a laptop or desktop computer. You
may use your own device, borrow a <strong>Chromebook</strong> from the
Library (first-come, first-served; semester-long loan due May 1 or
December 1), or work on <strong>library desktop computers</strong>
(Windows) available on the first and second floors. See the <a
href="https://library.smcm.edu/services/computers/">SMCM library
computing page</a> for details.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quizzes</strong> - Programming builds on many small
concepts that fit together to form larger systems. To help you stay on
track, there will be regular quizzes focused on these building
blocks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Midterm Exam</strong> and <strong>Final Exam</strong> -
These exams will assess your cumulative knowledge and problem-solving
skills.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Programming Project</strong> - A larger-scale programming
project will give you the opportunity to apply what you’ve learned in a
more open-ended context.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="grading" class="level2">
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>Your final grade will be based on the following components:</p>

<p>I will determine the exact letter-grade cutoffs at the end of the
course. To ensure fairness, I guarantee the <em>minimum</em> grade you
will receive based on your overall percentage:</p>
<p>If adjustments are made to the grading scale, they will only
<strong>raise</strong> your final letter grade, never lower it.</p>

earn for a given percentage.</p>

<section id="use-of-generative-ai" class="level2">
<h2>Use of Generative AI</h2>
<p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI) (tools such as ChatGPT,
Gemini, Copilot) is a fast-developing tool that greatly impacts the
learning process. As with many things, there are times when using these
tools is appropriate and when it is not.  For this course, <em>I
encourage you to use the generative AI tools</em> at your disposal,
including creating study guides or assisting with class assignments.
However it is your responsibility to properly evaluate the information
created through generative AI as well as <em>explicitly cite its use
within your assignments</em>. We will discuss how to do this in class,
and you should contact me with any questions that you may have if you
encounter a situation where it is unclear how to do these citations.
Failure to use the proper citation of generative AI tools may be
considered plagiarism and will be handled via the SMCM Academic
Misconduct policies.</p>
</section>
<section id="attendance-policy" class="level2">
<h2>Attendance Policy</h2>
<p>Attendance is not mandatory, and thus absence from class is not
penalized directly, but you will lose out in other ways. Class
attendance is the #1 indicator of academic success. OS3 emphatically
encourages all students to Go To Class! Class attendance is important
for numerous reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students tend to remember info more when they attend class.</li>
<li>Your presence in class shows your instructor that you care about the
course and it is important to you. If your grade is borderline at the
end of the semester, the instructor may give you the benefit of the
doubt because you regularly attended class.</li>
<li>You/your families are paying to be in class. In-state residents who
miss a class are wasting over $56 per class. Out-of-state students who
miss a class are throwing away $110 per class!</li>
<li>Your instructor will likely explain material differently/better than
you can learn it yourself, and can answer questions more directly.</li>
<li>Going to class helps you build community and relationships with
peers and your instructors.</li>
<li>By not going to class, you may miss a pop quiz, participation
points, extra credit opportunities, important info, or in-class
assignments that can impact your grade.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="late-work-policy" class="level2">
<h2>Late Work Policy</h2>
<p>Assignments are due at <strong>11:59 PM Eastern Time (UTC –
4)</strong> on the posted due date, with a one-hour grace period.
Submissions received after that time will be subject to a late penalty
of <strong>10% of the maximum possible points per additional
day</strong> past the deadline. The minimum grade on any assignment is
zero; late penalties will not reduce a score below this.</p>
<p>Because the penalty accumulates continuously, assignments submitted
several days late will earn little or no credit. Please plan accordingly
and submit on time.</p>
<p>This policy is designed to ensure fairness and to allow me to return
graded work to the class within two weeks of the due date.</p>
</section>
<section id="tentative-schedule" class="level2">
<h2>Tentative Schedule:</h2>
<p>The schedule below outlines our plan for the semester. As we move
through the course, I may adjust the pace, spend more or less time on
certain topics, or add/remove assignments and quizzes. These adjustments
will be made with your learning in mind, to ensure you have the time and
support needed to build a strong foundation in programming.</p>
