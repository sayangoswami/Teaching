<h2>Course Goals</h2>
<p>This course studies the design, implementation and analysis of
important algorithms. Topics include lower and upper complexity bounds,
algorithm analysis techniques, NP-completeness, sorting algorithms,
searching algorithms, graph algorithms, divide-and-conquer algorithms,
greedy algorithms, dynamic programming, backtracking, probabilistic
algorithms, and mathematical algorithms.</p>
</section>
<section id="learning-outcomes" class="level2">
<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Analyze the <em>best-case</em>, <em>average-case</em>, and
<em>worst-case asymptotic performance</em> of algorithms using standard
notations (Big-O, <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(\Theta\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p>Construct <em>correctness proofs</em> for algorithms using
techniques such as <em>loop invariants and mathematical
induction</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Compare and contrast major algorithms and data structures (such
as sorting, graph traversal, and hashing) to determine their suitability
for specific computational problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Apply key algorithmic design paradigms, including
<em>divide-and-conquer</em>, <em>dynamic programming</em>, and
<em>greedy</em> strategies, to solve complex problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Synthesize efficient algorithms for engineering design situations
and validate their performance through theoretical analysis and
empirical testing.</p></li>
<li><p>Categorize computational problems into <em>complexity
classes</em> (P, NP, NP-Complete) and identify when a problem is likely
to be <em>computationally intractable</em>.</p></li>

<h2>Wellness Center: Health Services and Counseling &amp; Psychological
Services (CAPS)</h2>
<p>A growing number of students are experiencing mental health
challenges to varying degrees. Doing what you can to stay ahead by
wisely taking care of yourself will be a key to succeeding
academically.  Sometimes mental health challenges can affect your
ability to complete required work. For example, a particular assignment
might trigger anxiety for you in ways which were not anticipated. Or,
maybe it becomes difficult to attend class due to mental health
challenges. In any of those cases please come and talk with more or send
me an email.  I’ll listen and do what I can to help. The sooner you
share your challenges with me, the better prepared I am to assist you. 
I am one of many people here at SMCM who care about you and your
welfare. For further support, the Wellness Center provides numerous
confidential health and counseling services including same day/next day
connections to counseling by calling <a

<section id="evaluation-components" class="level2">
<h2>Evaluation Components</h2>
<p>Your course grade will be based on homework assignments, quizzes, a
midterm exam, and a final exam. All components will emphasize algorithm
design and problem-solving.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Homework Assignments:</strong> Homework is the primary
vehicle for learning in this course. These sets will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Algorithm Design: Developing efficient solutions to complex
engineering problems.</li>
<li>Proofs: Providing mathematical justification (e.g., loop invariants,
induction) for algorithm correctness.</li>
<li>Complexity Analysis: Determining the asymptotic bounds (e.g., <span
class="math inline">\(O(n \log n)\)</span>) of your proposed
solutions.</li>
<li><em>Note:</em> Submission must be through pdf files, and <em>must be
typed (not hand written)</em>. Using Markdown with LaTeX is highly
encouraged to ensure clarity in mathematical notation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Quizzes</strong> Quizzes are short, low-stakes
assessments designed to ensure you are keeping up with core concepts.
These will focus on “familiarity” tasks, such as tracing a specific
algorithm (like Dijkstra’s or Quicksort) on a provided data set or
identifying the complexity class of a given function.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Midterm Exam</strong> and <strong>Final Exam</strong>
Exams will test your ability to synthesize the paradigms learned in
class under time constraints.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Midterm covers foundational analysis, sorting, and
divide-and-conquer.</li>
<li>The Final Exam is cumulative but will heavily emphasize dynamic
programming, greedy algorithms, and graph theory.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: All quizzes and exams will be
paper-based.</p>
</section>
<section id="grading" class="level2">
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>Your final grade will be based on the following components:</p>

<p>I will determine the exact letter-grade cutoffs at the end of the
course. To ensure fairness, I guarantee the <em>minimum</em> grade you
will receive based on your overall percentage:</p>
<p>If adjustments are made to the grading scale, they will only
<strong>raise</strong> your final letter grade, never lower it.</p>
<p>The table below represents the lowest possible letter grade you can
earn for a given percentage.</p>

<p>The grades would be published on Blackboard. ## Use of Generative
AI</p>
<p>Generative artificial intelligence (AI) (tools such as ChatGPT,
Gemini, Copilot) is a fast-developing tool that greatly impacts the
learning process. As with many things, there are times when using these
tools is appropriate and when it is not.  For this course, <em>I
encourage you to use the generative AI tools</em> at your disposal,
including creating study guides or assisting with class assignments.
However it is your responsibility to properly evaluate the information
created through generative AI as well as <em>explicitly cite its use
within your assignments</em>. We will discuss how to do this in class,
and you should contact me with any questions that you may have if you
encounter a situation where it is unclear how to do these citations.
Failure to use the proper citation of generative AI tools may be
considered plagiarism and will be handled via the SMCM Academic
Misconduct policies.</p>
</section>
<section id="attendance-policy" class="level2">
<h2>Attendance Policy</h2>
<p>Attendance is not mandatory, and thus absence from class is not
penalized directly, but you will lose out in other ways. Class
attendance is the #1 indicator of academic success. OS3 emphatically
encourages all students to Go To Class! Class attendance is important
for numerous reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Students tend to remember info more when they attend
class.</p></li>
<li><p>Your presence in class shows your instructor that you care about
the course and it is important to you. If your grade is borderline at
the end of the semester, the instructor may give you the benefit of the
doubt because you regularly attended class.</p></li>
<li><p>You/your families are paying to be in class. In-state residents
who miss a class are wasting over $56 per class. Out-of-state students
who miss a class are throwing away $110 per class!</p></li>
<li><p>Your instructor will likely explain material differently/better
than you can learn it yourself, and can answer questions more
directly.</p></li>
<li><p>Going to class helps you build community and relationships with
peers and your instructors.</p></li>
<li><p>By not going to class, you may miss a pop quiz, participation
points, extra credit opportunities, important info, or in-class
assignments that can impact your grade.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="late-work-policy" class="level2">
<h2>Late Work Policy</h2>
<p>Assignments are due at <strong>11:59 PM Eastern Time (UTC –
4)</strong> on the posted due date, with a one-hour grace period.
Submissions received after that time will be subject to a late penalty
of <strong>10% of the maximum possible points per additional
day</strong> past the deadline. The minimum grade on any assignment is
zero; late penalties will not reduce a score below this.</p>
<p>Because the penalty accumulates continuously, assignments submitted
several days late will earn little or no credit. Please plan accordingly
and submit on time.</p>
<p>This policy is designed to ensure fairness and to allow me to return
graded work to the class within two weeks of the due date.</p>
</section>
<section id="tentative-schedule" class="level2">
<h2>Tentative Schedule:</h2>
<p>The schedule below outlines our plan for the semester. As we move
through the course, I may adjust the pace, spend more or less time on
certain topics, or add/remove assignments and quizzes. These adjustments
will be made with your learning in mind, to ensure you have the time and
support needed to build a strong foundation.</p>
